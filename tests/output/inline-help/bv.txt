  Creates a new backup of the specified volume. For general information about
  volume backups, see [Overview of Block Volume Service Backups]

  When the request is received, the backup object is in a REQUEST_RECEIVED
  state. When the data is imaged, it goes into a CREATING state. After the
  backup is fully uploaded to the cloud, it goes into an AVAILABLE state.

Options:
  --volume-id TEXT                The OCID of the volume that needs to be backed
                                  up. [required]
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is

  Deletes the specified boot volume. The volume cannot have an active
  connection to an instance. To disconnect the boot volume from a connected
  instance, see [Disconnecting From a Boot Volume]. **Warning:** All data on
  the boot volume will be permanently lost when the boot volume is deleted.

Options:
  --boot-volume-id TEXT           The OCID of the boot volume. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort

                                  **Note:** In

                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the

                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [CREATING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|FAULTY|REQUEST_RECEIVED]

                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide

  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results

$ oci bv volume --help
Usage: oci bv volume [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A detachable block volume device that allows you to dynamically expand the
  storage capacity of an instance. For more information, see [Overview of
  Cloud Volume Storage].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new volume in the specified...
  delete  Deletes the specified volume.
  get     Gets information for the specified volume.
  list    Lists the volumes in the specified...
  update  Updates the specified volume's display name.

$ oci bv volume create --help
Usage: oci bv volume create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new volume in the specified compartment. Volumes can be created in
  sizes ranging from 50 GB (51200 MB) to 16 TB (16777216 MB), in 1 GB (1024
  MB) increments. By default, volumes are 1 TB (1048576 MB). For general
  information about block volumes, see [Overview of Block Volume Service].

  A volume and instance can be in separate compartments but must be in the
  same Availability Domain. For information about access control and
  compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about
  Availability Domains, see [Regions and Availability Domains]. To get a list
  of Availability Domains, use the `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the
  Identity and Access Management Service API.

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the volume, which is simply
  a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort

                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The

  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|RESTORING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|FAULTY]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.

Usage: oci bv volume-backup-policy-assignment get-volume-backup-policy-asset-assignment 
           [OPTIONS]

  Gets the volume backup policy assignment for the specified asset. Note that
  the assetId query parameter is required, and that the returned list will
  contain at most one item (since any given asset can only have one policy
  assigned to it).

Options:
  --asset-id TEXT   The OCID of an asset (e.g. a volume). [required]
  --limit INTEGER   For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page,
                    or items to return in a paginated "List" call. For important

                    Example: `50`
  --page TEXT       For list pagination. The value of the `opc-next-page`
                    response header from the previous "List" call. For important

$ oci bv volume-group create --help
Usage: oci bv volume-group create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new volume group in the specified compartment. A volume group is a
  collection of volumes and may be created from a list of volumes, cloning an
  existing volume group, or by restoring a volume group backup. A volume group
  can contain up to 64 volumes. You may optionally specify a *display name*
  for the volume group, which is simply a friendly name or description. It
  does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering
  confidential information.

  For more information, see [Volume Groups].

$ oci bv volume-group update --help
Usage: oci bv volume-group update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the set of volumes in a volume group along with the display name.
  Use this operation to add or remove volumes in a volume group. Specify the
  full list of volume IDs to include in the volume group. If the volume ID is
  not specified in the call, it will be removed from the volume group. Avoid
  entering confidential information.

  For more information, see [Volume Groups].

Options:
  --volume-group-id TEXT          The Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) that uniquely
                                  identifies the volume group. [required]

  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort

                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"

                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.

                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
