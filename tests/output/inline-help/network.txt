$ oci network cpe --help
Usage: oci network cpe [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  An object you create when setting up an IPSec VPN between your on-premises
  network and VCN. The `Cpe` is a virtual representation of your customer-
  premises equipment, which is the actual router on-premises at your site at
  your end of the IPSec VPN connection. For more information, see [Overview of
  the Networking Service].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network cpe create --help
Usage: oci network cpe create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new virtual customer-premises equipment (CPE) object in the
  specified compartment. For more information, see [IPSec VPNs].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE doesn't
  have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec connection or other
  Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to use,
  put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about
  compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You must provide the public IP address of your on-premises router. See
  [Configuring Your On-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the CPE, otherwise a default
  is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid
  entering confidential information.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT     The OCID of the compartment to contain the CPE.
                                [required]
  --ip-address TEXT             The public IP address of the on-premises router.

  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE   Defined tags for this resource. Each key is
                                predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more
                                information, see [Resource Tags].
                                
                                Example:
                                `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}`
                                This is a
                                complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
                                value can be provided as a string on the command
                                line or passed in as a file using
                                the
                                file://path/to/file syntax.
                                
                                The --generate-

                                Example: `{"Department":
                                "Finance"}`
                                This is a complex type whose value
                                must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as
                                a string on the command line or passed in as a
                                file using

  use cross-connects. For more information, see [FastConnect Overview].

  Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect in a [CrossConnectGroup] so
  you can use link aggregation with the connection.

  **Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to
  Oracle so customers can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that
  your connection is modeled the same way as a colocated customer's (with
  `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network cross-connect create --help
Usage: oci network cross-connect create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new cross-connect. Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect
  in a [CrossConnectGroup] so you can use link aggregation with the
  connection.

  After creating the `CrossConnect` object, you need to go the FastConnect
  location and request to have the physical cable installed. For more
  information, see [FastConnect Overview].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the cross-connect to reside. If you're not sure
  which compartment to use, put the cross-connect in the same compartment with
  your VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see
  [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource
  Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect. It does
  not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential
  information.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  cross-connect. [required]

$ oci network cross-connect-group --help
Usage: oci network cross-connect-group [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect group
  is a link aggregation group (LAG), which can contain one or more
  [CrossConnects]. Customers who are colocated with Oracle in a FastConnect
  location create and use cross-connect groups. For more information, see
  [FastConnect Overview].

  **Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to
  Oracle so customers can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that
  your connection is modeled the same way as a colocated customer's (with
  `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network cross-connect-group create --help
Usage: oci network cross-connect-group create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new cross-connect group to use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
  FastConnect. For more information, see [FastConnect Overview].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the cross-connect group to reside. If you're not
  sure which compartment to use, put the cross-connect group in the same
  compartment with your VCN. For more information about compartments and
  access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about
  OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect group. It
  does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering
  confidential information.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  cross-connect group. [required]

  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly.
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with

  have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, the DRG attachment, or other
  Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to use,
  put the DRG in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about
  compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For
  information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the DRG, otherwise a default
  is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid
  entering confidential information.

$ oci network drg-attachment create --help
Usage: oci network drg-attachment create [OPTIONS]

  Attaches the specified DRG to the specified VCN. A VCN can be attached to
  only one DRG at a time, and vice versa. The response includes a
  `DrgAttachment` object with its own OCID. For more information about DRGs,
  see [Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRGs)].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the attachment, otherwise a
  default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

  For the purposes of access control, the DRG attachment is automatically
  placed into the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about
  compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

Options:
  --drg-id TEXT                   The OCID of the DRG. [required]

Usage: oci network internet-gateway [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Represents a router that connects the edge of a VCN with the Internet. For
  an example scenario that uses an internet gateway, see [Typical Networking
  Service Scenarios].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network internet-gateway create --help
Usage: oci network internet-gateway create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new internet gateway for the specified VCN. For more information,
  see [Access to the Internet].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the Internet Gateway to reside. Notice that the
  internet gateway doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the Internet Gateway in the same compartment with the VCN. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the internet gateway,
  otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

  For traffic to flow between a subnet and an internet gateway, you must
  create a route rule accordingly in the subnet's route table (for example,
  0.0.0.0/0 > internet gateway). See [UpdateRouteTable].

  You must specify whether the internet gateway is enabled when you create it.
  If it's disabled, that means no traffic will flow to/from the internet even
  if there's a route rule that enables that traffic. You can later use
  [UpdateInternetGateway] to easily disable/enable the gateway without
  changing the route rule.

                                  pagination works, see [List Pagination].
  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly.
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.
                                  
                                  Options can still be
                                  provided on the command line. If an option
                                  exists in both the JSON document and the
                                  command line then the command line specified
                                  value will be used

$ oci network ip-sec-connection --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple
  IPSec tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when
  setting up an IPSec VPN. For more information, see [Overview of the
  Networking Service].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network ip-sec-connection create --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new IPSec connection between the specified DRG and CPE. For more
  information, see [IPSec VPNs].

  In the request, you must include at least one static route to the CPE object
  (you're allowed a maximum of 10). For example: 10.0.8.0/16.

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the IPSec connection to reside. Notice that the
  IPSec connection doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the DRG, CPE,
  or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment
  to use, put the IPSec connection in the same compartment as the DRG. For
  more information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the IPSec connection,
  otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can
  change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

  After creating the IPSec connection, you need to configure your on-premises
  router with tunnel-specific information returned by
  [GetIPSecConnectionDeviceConfig]. For each tunnel, that operation gives you
  the IP address of Oracle's VPN headend and the shared secret (that is, the
  pre-shared key). For more information, see [Configuring Your On-Premises
  Router for an IPSec VPN].

  To get the status of the tunnels (whether they're up or down), use
  [GetIPSecConnectionDeviceStatus].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the

$ oci network ip-sec-connection delete --help
Usage: oci network ip-sec-connection delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified IPSec connection. If your goal is to disable the IPSec
  VPN between your VCN and on-premises network, it's easiest to simply detach
  the DRG but keep all the IPSec VPN components intact. If you were to delete
  all the components and then later need to create an IPSec VPN again, you
  would need to configure your on-premises router again with the new
  information returned from [CreateIPSecConnection].

  This is an asynchronous operation. The connection's `lifecycleState` will
  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the connection is completely
  removed.

Options:
  --ipsc-id TEXT                  The OCID of the IPSec connection. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

$ oci network local-peering-gateway --help
Usage: oci network local-peering-gateway [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN peer
  with another VCN in the same region. *Peering* means that the two VCNs can
  communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing
  the internet or routing through your on-premises network. For more
  information, see [VCN Peering].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network local-peering-gateway connect --help
Usage: oci network local-peering-gateway connect [OPTIONS]

  Connects this local peering gateway (LPG) to another one in the same region.

  This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is designated as
  the *requestor* in the peering relationship. The *acceptor* must implement
  an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that gives the requestor
  permission to connect to LPGs in the acceptor's compartment. Without that
  permission, this operation will fail. For more information, see [VCN
  Peering].

$ oci network nat-gateway delete --help
Usage: oci network nat-gateway delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified NAT gateway. The NAT gateway does not have to be
  disabled, but there must not be a route rule that lists the NAT gateway as a
  target.

  This is an asynchronous operation. The NAT gateway's `lifecycleState` will
  change to TERMINATING temporarily until the NAT gateway is completely
  removed.

Options:
  --nat-gateway-id TEXT           The NAT gateway's [OCID]. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

                                  the given display name exactly.
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the specified lifecycle state. The value is
                                  case insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON

$ oci network private-ip --help
Usage: oci network private-ip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A *private IP* is a conceptual term that refers to a private IP address and
  related properties. The `privateIp` object is the API representation of a
  private IP.

  Each instance has a *primary private IP* that is automatically created and
  assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
  VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
  can't remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
  automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

  You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
  information, see the `privateIp` operations and also [IP Addresses].

  **Note:** Only [ListPrivateIps] and [GetPrivateIp] work with *primary*
  private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead work with
  instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP's properties
  come from the values you specify in [CreateVnicDetails] when calling either
  [LaunchInstance] or [AttachVnic]. To update the hostname for a primary
  private IP, you use [UpdateVnic].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network private-ip delete --help
Usage: oci network private-ip delete [OPTIONS]

  Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the
  object's OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet's pool of
  available addresses.

  This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are
  automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

  **Important:** If a secondary private IP is the [target of a route rule],
  unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole and the
  traffic will be dropped.

Options:
  --private-ip-id TEXT  The OCID of the private IP. [required]
  --if-match TEXT       For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE

                        value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response
                        for that resource.  The resource will be updated or

$ oci network private-ip list --help
Usage: oci network private-ip list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the [PrivateIp] objects based on one of these filters:

      - Subnet OCID.
      - VNIC OCID.
      - Both private IP address and subnet OCID: This lets you get a `privateIP` object
        based on its private IP address (for example, 10.0.3.3)  and not its OCID.
        For comparison, [GetPrivateIp] requires the OCID.

  If you're listing all the private IPs associated with a given subnet or
  VNIC, the response includes both primary and secondary private IPs.

$ oci network private-ip update --help
Usage: oci network private-ip update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified private IP. You must specify the object's OCID. Use
  this operation if you want to:

      - Change the display name for a secondary private IP.
      - Change the hostname for a secondary private IP.

  To move a secondary private IP to another VNIC, use the `bcms network vnic
  assign-private-ip` command with the --unassign-if-already-assigned switch.

  This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs. To update the
  hostname for the primary IP on a VNIC, use [UpdateVnic].

$ oci network public-ip --help
Usage: oci network public-ip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A *public IP* is a conceptual term that refers to a public IP address and
  related properties. The `publicIp` object is the API representation of a
  public IP.

  There are two types of public IPs: 1. Ephemeral 2. Reserved

  For more information and comparison of the two types, see [Public IP
  Addresses].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

Commands:

$ oci network public-ip create --help
Usage: oci network public-ip create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a public IP. Use the `lifetime` property to specify whether it's an
  ephemeral or reserved public IP. For information about limits on how many
  you can create, see [Public IP Addresses].

  * **For an ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP:** You must also
  specify a `privateIpId` with the OCID of the primary private IP you want to
  assign the public IP to. The public IP is created in the same availability
  domain as the private IP. An ephemeral public IP must always be assigned to
  a private IP, and only to the *primary* private IP on a VNIC, not a
  secondary private IP. Exception: If you create a [NatGateway], Oracle
  automatically assigns the NAT gateway a regional ephemeral public IP that
  you cannot remove.

  * **For a reserved public IP:** You may also optionally assign the public IP
  to a private IP by specifying `privateIpId`. Or you can later assign the
  public IP with [UpdatePublicIp].

  **Note:** When assigning a public IP to a private IP, the private IP must
  not already have a public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED.
  If it does, an error is returned.

  Also, for reserved public IPs, the optional assignment part of this
  operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to
  determine if the assignment succeeded.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  public IP. For ephemeral public IPs, you must
                                  set this to the private IP's compartment OCID.
                                  [required]
  --lifetime [EPHEMERAL|RESERVED]
                                  Defines when the public IP is deleted and
                                  released back to the Oracle Cloud
                                  Infrastructure public IP pool. For more

  **Note:** You cannot update, unassign, or delete the public IP that Oracle
  automatically assigned to an entity for you (such as a load balancer or NAT
  gateway). The public IP is automatically deleted if the assigned entity is
  terminated.

  For an assigned reserved public IP, the initial unassignment portion of this
  operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to
  determine if the operation succeeded.

  If you want to simply unassign a reserved public IP and return it to your
  pool of reserved public IPs, instead use [UpdatePublicIp].

Options:
  --public-ip-id TEXT             The OCID of the public IP. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

$ oci network public-ip list --help
Usage: oci network public-ip list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the [PublicIp] objects in the specified compartment. You can filter
  the list by using query parameters.

  To list your reserved public IPs:   * Set `scope` = `REGION`  (required)   *
  Leave the `availabilityDomain` parameter empty   * Set `lifetime` =
  `RESERVED`

  To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to a regional entity such as a NAT
  gateway:   * Set `scope` = `REGION`  (required)   * Leave the
  `availabilityDomain` parameter empty   * Set `lifetime` = `EPHEMERAL`

  To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to private IPs:   * Set `scope` =
  `AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN` (required)   * Set the `availabilityDomain` parameter
  to the desired availability domain (required)   * Set `lifetime` =
  `EPHEMERAL`

  **Note:** An ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP is always in the
  same availability domain and compartment as the private IP.

Options:
  --scope [REGION|AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN]
                                  Whether the public IP is regional or specific
                                  to a particular availability domain.

$ oci network public-ip update --help
Usage: oci network public-ip update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified public IP. You must specify the object's OCID. Use
  this operation if you want to:

  * Assign a reserved public IP in your pool to a private IP. * Move a
  reserved public IP to a different private IP. * Unassign a reserved public
  IP from a private IP (which returns it to your pool of reserved public IPs).
  * Change the display name or tags for a public IP.

  Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are asynchronous
  operations. Poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if the
  operation succeeded.

  **Note:** When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must not
  already have a public IP with `lifecycleState` = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If
  it does, an error is returned. Also, the initial unassignment from the
  original private IP always succeeds, but the assignment to the target
  private IP is asynchronous and could fail silently (for example, if the
  target private IP is deleted or has a different public IP assigned to it in
  the interim). If that occurs, the public IP remains unassigned and its
  `lifecycleState` switches to AVAILABLE (it is not reassigned to its original
  private IP). You must poll the public IP's `lifecycleState` to determine if
  the move succeeded.

  Regarding ephemeral public IPs:

  * If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private IP, use
  [CreatePublicIp]. * You can't move an ephemeral public IP to a different
  private IP. * If you want to unassign an ephemeral public IP from its
  private IP, use [DeletePublicIp], which unassigns and deletes the ephemeral
  public IP.

  **Note:** If a public IP is assigned to a secondary private IP (see
  [PrivateIp]), and you move that secondary private IP to another VNIC, the
  public IP moves with it.

  **Note:** There's a limit to the number of [public IPs] a VNIC or instance
  can have. If you try to move a reserved public IP to a VNIC or instance that
  has already reached its public IP limit, an error is returned. For
  information about the public IP limits, see [Public IP Addresses].

Options:
  --public-ip-id TEXT             The OCID of the public IP. [required]

$ oci network remote-peering-connection --help
Usage: oci network remote-peering-connection [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A remote peering connection (RPC) is an object on a DRG that lets the VCN
  that is attached to the DRG peer with a VCN in a different region. *Peering*
  means that the two VCNs can communicate using private IP addresses, but
  without the traffic traversing the internet or routing through your on-
  premises network. For more information, see [VCN Peering].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network remote-peering-connection connect --help
Usage: oci network remote-peering-connection connect [OPTIONS]

  Connects this RPC to another one in a different region.

  This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is designated as
  the *requestor* in the peering relationship. The *acceptor* must implement
  an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that gives the requestor
  permission to connect to RPCs in the acceptor's compartment. Without that
  permission, this operation will fail. For more information, see [VCN
  Peering].

$ oci network route-table create --help
Usage: oci network route-table create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new route table for the specified VCN. In the request you must
  also include at least one route rule for the new route table. For
  information on the number of rules you can have in a route table, see
  [Service Limits]. For general information about route tables in your VCN and
  the types of targets you can use in route rules, see [Route Tables].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the route table to reside. Notice that the route
  table doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, subnets, or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the route table in the same compartment as the VCN. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the route table, otherwise a
  default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

Options:

$ oci network security-list --help
Usage: oci network security-list [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A set of virtual firewall rules for your VCN. Security lists are configured
  at the subnet level, but the rules are applied to the ingress and egress
  traffic for the individual instances in the subnet. The rules can be
  stateful or stateless. For more information, see [Security Lists].

  **Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images
  automatically include firewall rules (for example, Linux iptables, Windows
  firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance, make
  sure both the security lists associated with the instance's subnet and the
  instance's firewall rules are set correctly.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

Options:

$ oci network security-list create --help
Usage: oci network security-list create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new security list for the specified VCN. For more information
  about security lists, see [Security Lists]. For information on the number of
  rules you can have in a security list, see [Service Limits].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the security list to reside. Notice that the
  security list doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN,
  subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which
  compartment to use, put the security list in the same compartment as the
  VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see
  [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource
  Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the security list, otherwise
  a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  security list. [required]

$ oci network service-gateway --help
Usage: oci network service-gateway [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Represents a router that connects the edge of a VCN with public Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure services such as Object Storage. Traffic leaving the VCN and
  destined for a supported public service (see [ListServices]) is routed
  through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The
  instances in the VCN do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a
  public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway for this traffic.
  For more information, see [Access to Object Storage: Service Gateway].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network service-gateway attach --help
Usage: oci network service-gateway attach [OPTIONS]

  Enables the specified service on the specified gateway. In other words,
  enables the service gateway to send traffic to the specified service. You
  must also set up a route rule with the service's `cidrBlock` as the rule's
  destination CIDR and the gateway as the rule's target. See [Route Table].

  **Note:** The `AttachServiceId` operation is an easy way to enable an
  individual service on the service gateway. Compare it with
  [UpdateServiceGateway], which also lets you enable an individual service.
  However, with `UpdateServiceGateway`, you must specify the *entire* list of
  services you want enabled on the service gateway.

Options:
  --service-gateway-id TEXT       The service gateway's [OCID]. [required]
  --service-id TEXT               The [OCID] of the service. [required]

$ oci network service-gateway detach --help
Usage: oci network service-gateway detach [OPTIONS]

  Disables the specified service on the specified gateway. In other words,
  stops the service gateway from sending traffic to the specified service. You
  do not need to remove any route rules that specify this service's
  `cidrBlock` as the destination CIDR. However, consider removing the rules if
  your intent is to permanently disable use of the service through this
  service gateway.

  **Note:** The `DetachServiceId` operation is an easy way to disable an
  individual service on the service gateway. Compare it with
  [UpdateServiceGateway], which also lets you disable an individual service.
  However, with `UpdateServiceGateway`, you must specify the *entire* list of
  services you want enabled on the service gateway. `UpdateServiceGateway`
  also lets you block all traffic through the service gateway without having
  to disable each of the individual services.

Options:
  --service-gateway-id TEXT       The service gateway's [OCID]. [required]
  --service-id TEXT               The [OCID] of the service. [required]

                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.

                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The

$ oci network service-gateway update --help
Usage: oci network service-gateway update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified service gateway. The information you provide
  overwrites the existing attributes of the gateway.

Options:
  --service-gateway-id TEXT       The service gateway's [OCID]. [required]
  --block-traffic BOOLEAN         Whether the service gateway blocks all traffic
                                  through it. The default is `false`. When this
                                  is `true`, traffic is not routed to any
                                  services, regardless of route rules.
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `true`
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is

  --services COMPLEX TYPE         List of all the services you want enabled on
                                  this service gateway. Sending an empty list
                                  means you want to disable all services.
                                  Omitting this parameter entirely keeps the
                                  existing list of services intact.
                                  
                                  You can

                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.

                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see

$ oci network subnet --help
Usage: oci network subnet [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A logical subdivision of a VCN. Each subnet exists in a single availability
  domain and consists of a contiguous range of IP addresses that do not
  overlap with other subnets in the VCN. Example: 172.16.1.0/24. For more
  information, see [Overview of the Networking Service] and [VCNs and
  Subnets].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  For detailed help on any of these individual commands, enter
                  <command> --help.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new subnet in the specified VCN.
  delete  Deletes the specified subnet, but only if...
  get     Gets the specified subnet's information.
  list    Lists the subnets in the specified VCN and...
  update  Updates the specified subnet.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci network subnet create --help
Usage: oci network subnet create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new subnet in the specified VCN. You can't change the size of the
  subnet after creation, so it's important to think about the size of subnets
  you need before creating them. For more information, see [VCNs and Subnets].
  For information on the number of subnets you can have in a VCN, see [Service
  Limits].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the subnet to reside. Notice that the subnet
  doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, route tables, or
  other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
  use, put the subnet in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information
  about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service].
  For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally associate a route table with the subnet. If you don't,
  the subnet will use the VCN's default route table. For more information
  about route tables, see [Route Tables].

  You may optionally associate a security list with the subnet. If you don't,
  the subnet will use the VCN's default security list. For more information
  about security lists, see [Security Lists].

  You may optionally associate a set of DHCP options with the subnet. If you
  don't, the subnet will use the VCN's default set. For more information about
  DHCP options, see [DHCP Options].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the subnet, otherwise a
  default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
  Avoid entering confidential information.

  You can also add a DNS label for the subnet, which is required if you want
  the Internet and VCN Resolver to resolve hostnames for instances in the
  subnet. For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network].

Options:
  --cidr-block TEXT               The CIDR IP address range of the subnet.
                                  Example: `172.16.1.0/24` [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  subnet. [required]
  --vcn-id TEXT                   The OCID of the VCN to contain the subnet.
                                  [required]
  --availability-domain TEXT      The availability domain to contain the subnet.
                                  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1`
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is

                                  This is a complex
                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value

                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --prohibit-public-ip-on-vnic BOOLEAN
                                  Whether VNICs within this subnet can have
                                  public IP addresses. Defaults to false, which
                                  means VNICs created in this subnet will
                                  automatically be assigned public IP addresses
                                  unless specified otherwise during instance
                                  launch (with the `--assign-public-ip` flag).
                                  If `--prohibit-public-ip-on-vnic` is set to
                                  true, VNICs created in this subnet cannot have
                                  public IP addresses (i.e., it's a private

                                  use. If you don't provide a value, the subnet
                                  uses the VCN's default route table.
  --security-list-ids COMPLEX TYPE
                                  The OCIDs of the security list or lists the
                                  subnet will use. If you don't provide a value,
                                  the subnet uses the VCN's default security
                                  list. Remember that security lists are
                                  associated *with the subnet*, but the rules
                                  are applied to the individual VNICs in the
                                  subnet.
                                  This is a complex type whose value
                                  must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
                                  as a string on the command line or passed in
                                  as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file
                                  syntax.

                                  option can be used to generate an example of
                                  the JSON which must be provided. We recommend
                                  storing this example

$ oci network subnet delete --help
Usage: oci network subnet delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified subnet, but only if there are no instances in the
  subnet. This is an asynchronous operation. The subnet's `lifecycleState`
  will change to TERMINATING temporarily. If there are any instances in the
  subnet, the state will instead change back to AVAILABLE.

Options:
  --subnet-id TEXT                The OCID of the subnet. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT

                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by

                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]

                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci network vcn create --help
Usage: oci network vcn create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new virtual cloud network (VCN). For more information, see [VCNs
  and Subnets].

  For the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block. Oracle
  recommends using one of the private IP address ranges specified in [RFC
  1918] (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The
  CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it must not overlap with your on-
  premises network. You can't change the size of the VCN after creation.

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud
  Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which
  compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same
  compartment as the subnets or other Networking Service components. For more
  information about compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM
  Service]. For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default
  is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid
  entering confidential information.

  You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the
  instances to use the Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN.
  For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network].

  The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security
  list, and default set of DHCP options. The OCID for each is returned in the
  response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their
  contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).

  The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an
  internet gateway or set up an IPSec VPN or FastConnect. For more
  information, see [Overview of the Networking Service].

Options:
  --cidr-block TEXT               The CIDR IP address block of the VCN.
                                  Example: `172.16.0.0/16` [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  VCN. [required]
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is

                                  You must set this value if you want
                                  instances to be able to use hostnames to
                                  resolve other instances in the VCN. Otherwise
                                  the Internet and VCN Resolver will not work.

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the

                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results

  [FastConnect Overview].

  Each virtual circuit is made up of information shared between a customer,
  Oracle, and a provider (if the customer is using FastConnect via a
  provider). Who fills in a given property of a virtual circuit depends on
  whether the BGP session related to that virtual circuit goes from the
  customer's edge router to Oracle, or from the provider's edge router to
  Oracle. Also, in the case where the customer is using a provider, values for
  some of the properties may not be present immediately, but may get filled in
  as the provider and Oracle each do their part to provision the virtual
  circuit.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
  information when you supply string values using the API.

$ oci network virtual-circuit create --help
Usage: oci network virtual-circuit create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new virtual circuit to use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
  FastConnect. For more information, see [FastConnect Overview].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the virtual circuit to reside. If you're not sure
  which compartment to use, put the virtual circuit in the same compartment
  with the DRG it's using. For more information about compartments and access
  control, see [Overview of the IAM Service]. For information about OCIDs, see
  [Resource Identifiers].

  You may optionally specify a *display name* for the virtual circuit. It does
  not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential
  information.

  **Important:** When creating a virtual circuit, you specify a DRG for the
  traffic to flow through. Make sure you attach the DRG to your VCN and
  confirm the VCN's routing sends traffic to the DRG. Otherwise traffic will
  not flow. For more information, see [Route Tables].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment to contain the
                                  virtual circuit. [required]

$ oci network virtual-circuit update --help
Usage: oci network virtual-circuit update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified virtual circuit. This can be called by either the
  customer who owns the virtual circuit, or the provider (when provisioning or
  de-provisioning the virtual circuit from their end). The documentation for
  [UpdateVirtualCircuitDetails] indicates who can update each property of the
  virtual circuit.

  **Important:** If the virtual circuit is working and in the PROVISIONED
  state, updating any of the network-related properties (such as the DRG being
  used, the BGP ASN, and so on) will cause the virtual circuit's state to
  switch to PROVISIONING and the related BGP session to go down. After Oracle
  re-provisions the virtual circuit, its state will return to PROVISIONED.
  Make sure you confirm that the associated BGP session is back up. For more
  information about the various states and how to test connectivity, see
  [FastConnect Overview].

  To change the list of public IP prefixes for a public virtual circuit, use
  [BulkAddVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes] and
  [BulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes]. Updating the list of prefixes does
  NOT cause the BGP session to go down. However, Oracle must verify the
  customer's ownership of each added prefix before traffic for that prefix
  will flow across the virtual circuit.

Options:
  --virtual-circuit-id TEXT       The OCID of the virtual circuit. [required]
  --bandwidth-shape-name TEXT     The provisioned data rate of the connection.
                                  To get a list of the available bandwidth
                                  levels (that is, shapes), see [ListFastConnect
                                  ProviderVirtualCircuitBandwidthShapes]. To be
                                  updated only by the customer who owns the
                                  virtual circuit.
  --cross-connect-mappings COMPLEX TYPE

                                  connect group associated with this virtual
                                  circuit.
                                  
                                  The customer and provider can update
                                  different properties in the mapping depending
                                  on the situation. See the description of the
                                  [CrossConnectMapping].

$ oci network vnic --help
Usage: oci network vnic [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN. An
  instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN
  through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC* that is
  automatically created and attached during launch. You can add *secondary
  VNICs* to an instance after it's launched. For more information, see
  [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)].

  Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned during
  launch. You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created.
  For more information, see [CreatePrivateIp] and [IP Addresses].

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

  --skip-source-dest-check BOOLEAN
                                  Whether the source/destination check is
                                  disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to `false`,
                                  which means the check is performed. For
                                  information about why you would skip the
                                  source/destination check, see [Using a Private

                                  Example: `true`
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.
                                  
                                  Options can still be
                                  provided on the command line. If an option
                                  exists in both the JSON document and the
                                  command line then the command line specified
                                  value will be used
  -?, -h, --help                  For detailed help on any of these individual
                                  commands, enter <command> --help.
