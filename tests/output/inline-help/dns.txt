                                  The common pattern (or lack thereof) to which
                                  the steering policy adheres. This value
                                  restricts the possible configurations of
                                  rules, but thereby supports specifically
                                  tailored interfaces. Values other than
                                  "CUSTOM" require the rules to begin with an
                                  unconditional FILTER that keeps answers
                                  contingent upon `answer.isDisabled != true`,
                                  followed _if and only if the policy references

                                  an unconditional LIMIT. What must precede the
                                  LIMIT rule is determined by the template
                                  value: - FAILOVER requires exactly an
                                  unconditional PRIORITY rule that ranks answers
                                  by pool.   Each answer pool must have a unique
                                  priority value assigned to it. Answer data
                                  must   be defined in the `defaultAnswerData`
                                  property for the rule and the `cases` property
                                  must not be defined. - LOAD_BALANCE requires
                                  exactly an unconditional WEIGHTED rule that
                                  shuffles answers   by name. Answer data must
                                  be defined in the `defaultAnswerData` property
                                  for the   rule and the `cases` property must
                                  not be defined. - ROUTE_BY_GEO requires
                                  exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers
                                  by pool using the   geographical location of
                                  the client as a condition. Within that rule
                                  you may only   use `query.client.geoKey` in
                                  the `caseCondition` expressions for defining
                                  the cases.   For each case in the PRIORITY
                                  rule each answer pool must have a unique
                                  priority   value assigned to it. Answer data
                                  can only be defined within cases and
                                  `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used in the
                                  PRIORITY rule. - ROUTE_BY_ASN requires exactly
                                  one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool
                                  using the   ASN of the client as a condition.
                                  Within that rule you may only use
                                  `query.client.asn` in the `caseCondition`
                                  expressions for defining the cases.   For each
                                  case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool
                                  must have a unique priority   value assigned
                                  to it. Answer data can only be defined within
                                  cases and   `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used
                                  in the PRIORITY rule. - ROUTE_BY_IP requires
                                  exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers
                                  by pool using the   IP subnet of the client as
                                  a condition. Within that rule you may only use
                                  `query.client.address` in the `caseCondition`
                                  expressions for defining the cases.   For each
                                  case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool
                                  must have a unique priority   value assigned
                                  to it. Answer data can only be defined within
                                  cases and   `defaultAnswerData` cannot be used
                                  in the PRIORITY rule. - CUSTOM allows an
                                  arbitrary configuration of rules.
                                  
                                  For an

                                  may be changed to any of the supported options
                                  but the resulting policy must conform to the
                                  requirements for the new template type or else
                                  a Bad Request error will be returned.

                                  policy. A steering policy answer with `rdata`
                                  matching a monitored endpoint will use the
                                  health data of that endpoint. A steering
                                  policy answer with `rdata` not matching any

                                  using the   ASN of the client as a condition.
                                  Within that rule you may only use
                                  `query.client.asn` in the `caseCondition`

  Updates the specified secondary zone with your new external master server
  information. For more information about secondary zone, see [Manage DNS
  Service Zone].

Options:
  --zone-name-or-id TEXT          The name or OCID of the target zone.
                                  [required]
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type, or scope. For more
                                  information, see [Resource Tags]. Example:
                                  `{"bar-key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type
                                  whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
                                  be provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to a namespace. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "value"}}`
                                  This
                                  is a complex type whose value must be valid
                                  JSON. The value can be provided as a string on
                                  the command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The
                                  --generate-param-json-input option can be used
                                  to generate an example of the JSON which must
                                  be provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --external-masters COMPLEX TYPE
                                  External master servers for the zone.
                                  `externalMasters` becomes a required parameter
                                  when the `zoneType` value is `SECONDARY`.
                                  This option is a JSON list with items of type
                                  ExternalMaster.  For documentation on
                                  ExternalMaster please see our API reference: h

                                  This is a
                                  complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
                                  The value can be provided as a string on the
                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 The `If-Match` header field makes the request
                                  method conditional on the existence of at
                                  least one current representation of the target
                                  resource, when the field-value is `*`, or
                                  having a current representation of the target
                                  resource that has an entity-tag matching a
                                  member of the list of entity-tags provided in
                                  the field-value.
  --if-unmodified-since TEXT      The `If-Unmodified-Since` header field makes
                                  the request method conditional on the selected
                                  representation's last modification date being
                                  earlier than or equal to the date provided in
                                  the field-value.  This field accomplishes the
                                  same purpose as If-Match for cases where the
                                  user agent does not have an entity-tag for the
                                  representation.
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment the resource
                                  belongs to.

                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACTIVE|CREATING|DELETED|DELETING|FAILED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
