$ oci dns record zone update --help
Usage: oci dns record zone update [OPTIONS]

  Replaces records in the specified zone with the records specified in the
  request body. If a specified record does not exist, it will be created. If
  the record exists, then it will be updated to represent the record in the
  body of the request. If a record in the zone does not exist in the request
  body, the record will be removed from the zone.

  --if-unmodified-since TEXT      The `If-Unmodified-Since` header field makes

                                  representation's last modification date being

  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment the resource
                                  belongs to.

                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACTIVE|CREATING|DELETED|DELETING|FAILED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON

                                  Options can still be
                                  provided on the command line. If an option
                                  exists in both the JSON document and the
                                  command line then the command line specified
                                  value will be used
