$ oci fs --help
Usage: oci fs [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  The CLI for the File Storage Service.

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  export        A file system and the path that you can use...
  export-set    A set of file systems to export through one...
  file-system   An NFS file system.
  mount-target  Provides access to a collection of file...
  snapshot      A point-in-time snapshot of a specified file...

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ oci fs export --help
Usage: oci fs export [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
  resource belongs to exactly one export set.

  The export's path attribute is not a path in the referenced file system, but
  the value used by clients for the path component of the remotetarget
  argument when mounting the file system.

  The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
  slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
  the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
  sequence for the first export resource can't contain the complete path
  element sequence of the second export resource.

   For example, the following are acceptable:

    * /example and /path   * /example1 and /example2   * /example and
    /example1

  The following examples are not acceptable:   * /example and /example/path
  * / and /example

  Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.) or two
  periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.

  No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can reference
  the same file system.

  Use `exportOptions` to control access to an export. For more information,
  see [Export Options].

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create  Creates a new export in the specified export...
  delete  Deletes the specified export.
  get     Gets the specified export's information.
  list    Lists export resources by compartment, file...
  update  Updates the specified export's information.

                                  **Note:** Mount targets do not have Internet-
                                  routable IP   addresses.  Therefore they will
                                  not be reachable from the   Internet, even if
                                  an associated `ClientOptions` item has   a
                                  source of `0.0.0.0/0`.
                                  
                                    **If set to the
                                  empty array then the export will not be
                                  visible to any clients.**
                                  
                                    The export's
                                  `exportOptions` can be changed after creation
                                  using the `UpdateExport` operation.

                                  descending order. When you sort by path,

$ oci fs file-system --help
Usage: oci fs file-system [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  An NFS file system. To allow access to a file system, add it to an export
  set and associate the export set with a mount target. The same file system
  can be in multiple export sets and associated with multiple mount targets.

  To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy.
  If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an
  administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting
  Started with Policies].

$ oci fs file-system create --help
Usage: oci fs file-system create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and availability
  domain. Instances can mount file systems in another availability domain, but
  doing so might increase latency when compared to mounting instances in the
  same availability domain.

  After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount target.
  Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the mount target's
  IP address. You can associate a file system with more than one mount target
  at a time.

  For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service].

  For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of availability domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including file systems, get an
  Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When
  you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type or by viewing the resource in the Console.

Commands:

$ oci fs mount-target create --help
Usage: oci fs mount-target create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new mount target in the specified compartment and subnet. You can
  associate a file system with a mount target only when they exist in the same
  availability domain. Instances can connect to mount targets in another
  availablity domain, but you might see higher latency than with instances in
  the same availability domain as the mount target.

  Mount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can provide as
  the host portion of remote target parameters in client mount commands. These
  private IP addresses are listed in the privateIpIds property of the mount
  target and are highly available. Mount targets also consume additional IP
  addresses in their subnet. Do not use /30 or smaller subnets for mount
  target creation because they do not have sufficient available IP addresses.
  Allow at least three IP addresses for each mount target.

  For information about access control and compartments, see [Overview of the
  IAM Service].

  For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of availability domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services resources, including mount targets,
  get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can
  also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that
  resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

Options:
  --availability-domain TEXT      The availability domain in which to create the
