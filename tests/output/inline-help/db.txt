  --fault-domains COMPLEX TYPE    A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and
                                  infrastructure within an availability domain.
                                  fault domains let you distribute your
                                  instances so that they are not on the same
                                  physical hardware within a single availability
                                  domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that
                                  affects one fault domain does not affect DB
                                  systems in other fault domains.
                                  
                                  If you do not
                                  specify the fault domain, the system selects
                                  one for you. To change the fault domain for a
                                  DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB
                                  system in the preferred fault domain.
                                  
                                  If the
                                  node count is greater than 1, you can specify
                                  which fault domains these nodes will be
                                  distributed into. The system assigns your
                                  nodes automatically to the fault domains you
                                  specify so that no fault domain contains more
                                  than one node.
                                  
                                  To get a list of fault

                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --admin-password TEXT           A strong password for SYS, SYSTEM, and PDB

$ oci db system launch-from-backup --help
Usage: oci db system launch-from-backup [OPTIONS]

  Launches a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability
  domain. The Oracle Database edition that you specify applies to all the
  databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be changed.

  An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request
  parameters you provide and some default options. For more information, see
  [Default Options for the Initial Database].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment the DB system
                                  belongs in. [required]
  --availability-domain TEXT      The availability domain where the DB system is
                                  located. [required]
  --subnet-id TEXT                The [OCID] of the subnet the DB system is
                                  associated with.
                                  
                                  **Subnet Restrictions:** -
                                  For bare metal DB systems and for single node
                                  virtual machine DB systems, do not use a
                                  subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. -
                                  For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB
                                  systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps
                                  with 192.168.128.0/20.
                                  
                                  These subnets are used
                                  by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect
                                  on the database instance. Specifying an
                                  overlapping subnet will cause the private
                                  interconnect to malfunction. This restriction
                                  applies to both the client subnet and the
                                  backup subnet. [required]
  --shape TEXT                    The shape of the DB system. The shape
                                  determines resources allocated to the DB
                                  system. - For virtual machine shapes, the
                                  number of CPU cores and memory - For bare
                                  metal and Exadata shapes, the number of CPU
                                  cores, memory, and storage
                                  
                                  To get a list of
                                  shapes, use the [ListDbSystemShapes]
                                  operation. [required]
  --hostname TEXT                 The hostname for the DB system. The hostname
                                  must begin with an alphabetic character and
                                  can contain a maximum of 30 alphanumeric
                                  characters, including hyphens (-).
                                  
                                  The
                                  maximum length of the combined hostname and
                                  domain is 63 characters.
                                  
                                  **Note:** The
                                  hostname must be unique within the subnet. If
                                  it is not unique, the DB system will fail to
                                  provision. [required]
  --cpu-core-count INTEGER        The number of CPU cores to enable for a bare
                                  metal or Exadata DB system. The valid values
                                  depend on the specified shape:
                                  
                                  -

                                  This parameter is not used for
                                  virtual machine DB systems because virtual
                                  machine DB systems have a set number of cores

  --fault-domains COMPLEX TYPE    A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and
                                  infrastructure within an availability domain.
                                  fault domains let you distribute your
                                  instances so that they are not on the same
                                  physical hardware within a single availability
                                  domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that
                                  affects one fault domain does not affect DB
                                  systems in other fault domains.
                                  
                                  If you do not
                                  specify the fault domain, the system selects
                                  one for you. To change the fault domain for a
                                  DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB
                                  system in the preferred fault domain.
                                  
                                  If the
                                  node count is greater than 1, you can specify
                                  which fault domains these nodes will be
                                  distributed into. The system assigns your
                                  nodes automatically to the fault domains you
                                  specify so that no fault domain contains more
                                  than one node.
                                  
                                  To get a list of fault
                                  domains, use the [ListFaultDomains] operation
                                  in the Identity and Access Management Service
                                  API.
