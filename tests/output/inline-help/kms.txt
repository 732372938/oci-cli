  --key-id TEXT     The OCID of the key. [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file
                    using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                    
                    The --generate-full-
                    command-json-input option can be used to generate a sample
                    json file to be used with this command option. The key names
                    are pre-populated and match the command option names
                    (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                    compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be
                    populated by the user before using the sample file as an
                    input to this command. For any command option that accepts
                    multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                    Options can still be provided on the command line. If an
                    option exists in both the JSON document and the command line
                    then the command line specified value will be used.

  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "foo-value"}}`
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the key. It does not
                                  have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid

  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists
                                  for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-
                                  key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.

                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

$ oci kms management vault get --help
Usage: oci kms management vault get [OPTIONS]

  Gets the specified vault's configuration information.

Options:
  --vault-id TEXT   The OCID of the vault. [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file
                    using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                    
                    The --generate-full-
                    command-json-input option can be used to generate a sample
                    json file to be used with this command option. The key names
                    are pre-populated and match the command option names
                    (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                    compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be
                    populated by the user before using the sample file as an
                    input to this command. For any command option that accepts
                    multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                    Options can still be provided on the command line. If an
                    option exists in both the JSON document and the command line
                    then the command line specified value will be used.

$ oci kms management vault update --help
Usage: oci kms management vault update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the properties of a vault. Specifically, you can update the
  `displayName`, `freeformTags`, and `definedTags` properties. Furthermore,
  the vault must be in an `ACTIVE` or `CREATING` state to be updated.

Options:
  --vault-id TEXT                 The OCID of the vault. [required]
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "foo-value"}}`
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the vault. It does
                                  not have to be unique, and it is changeable.
                                  Avoid entering confidential information.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists
                                  for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-
                                  key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED|PENDING_DELETION|SCHEDULING_DELETION|CANCELLING_DELETION]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
