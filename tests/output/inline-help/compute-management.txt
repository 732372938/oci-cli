Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The OCID of the compartment containing the
                                  instance configuration. [required]
  --instance-details COMPLEX TYPE
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this

                                  command line or passed in as a file using

                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file.
