Usage: oci lb backend create [OPTIONS]

  Adds a backend server to a backend set.

Options:
  --ip-address TEXT               The IP address of the backend server.
                                  Example: `10.0.0.3` [required]
  --port INTEGER                  The communication port for the backend server.
                                  Example: `8080` [required]
  --load-balancer-id TEXT         The [OCID] of the load balancer associated
                                  with the backend set and servers. [required]
  --backend-set-name TEXT         The name of the backend set to add the backend
                                  server to.
                                  
                                  Example: `example_backend_set`
                                  [required]
  --backup BOOLEAN                Whether the load balancer should treat this
                                  server as a backup unit. If `true`, the load
                                  balancer forwards no ingress traffic to this
                                  backend server unless all other backend
                                  servers not marked as "backup" fail the health

  --drain BOOLEAN                 Whether the load balancer should drain this
                                  server. Servers marked "drain" receive no new
                                  incoming traffic.
                                  
                                  Example: `false`

  --weight INTEGER                The load balancing policy weight assigned to
                                  the server. Backend servers with a higher
                                  weight receive a larger proportion of incoming
                                  traffic. For example, a server weighted '3'
                                  receives 3 times the number of new connections
                                  as a server weighted '1'. For more information

                                  successful only if a reply returns within this

                                  Whether the load balancer is prevented from
                                  directing traffic from a persistent session

$ oci lb load-balancer create --help
Usage: oci lb load-balancer create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new load balancer in the specified compartment. For general
  information about load balancers, see [Overview of the Load Balancing
  Service].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the load balancer to reside. Notice that the load
  balancer doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or backend
  set. If you're not sure which compartment to use, put the load balancer in
  the same compartment as the VCN. For information about access control and
  compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  You must specify a display name for the load balancer. It does not have to
  be unique, and you can change it.

  For information about Availability Domains, see [Regions and Availability
  Domains]. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the
  `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access Management
  Service API.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including load balancers, get an
  Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When
  you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see
  [Resource Identifiers].

  After you send your request, the new object's state will temporarily be
  PROVISIONING. Before using the object, first make sure its state has changed
  to RUNNING.

  When you create a load balancer, the system assigns an IP address. To get
  the IP address, use the [GetLoadBalancer] operation.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment in which to
                                  create the load balancer. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name. It does not have to be
                                  unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering
                                  confidential information.

                                  To get a list of available shapes, use the
                                  [ListShapes] operation.

  --is-private BOOLEAN            Whether the load balancer has a VCN-local
                                  (private) IP address.
                                  
                                  If "true", the service
                                  assigns a private IP address to the load
                                  balancer. The load balancer requires only one
                                  subnet to host both the primary and secondary
                                  load balancers. The private IP address is
                                  local to the subnet. The load balancer is
                                  accessible only from within the VCN that
                                  contains the associated subnet, or as further
                                  restricted by your security list rules. The
                                  load balancer can route traffic to any backend
                                  server that is reachable from the VCN.
                                  
                                  For a
                                  private load balancer, both the primary and
                                  secondary load balancer hosts are within the
                                  same Availability Domain.

                                  service assigns a public IP address to the
                                  load balancer. A load balancer with a public
                                  IP address requires two subnets, each in a
                                  different Availability Domain. One subnet
                                  hosts the primary load balancer and the other
                                  hosts the secondary (standby) load balancer. A
                                  public load balancer is accessible from the
                                  internet, depending on your VCN's [security
                                  list rules].
