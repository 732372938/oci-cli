Options:
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the alarm. It does
                                  not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
                                  Avoid entering confidential information.
                                  
                                  This
                                  name is sent as the title for notifications
                                  related to this alarm.
                                  
                                  Example: `High CPU
                                  Utilization` [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment containing the
                                  alarm. [required]
  --metric-compartment-id TEXT    The [OCID] of the compartment containing the
                                  metric being evaluated by the alarm.
                                  [required]
  --namespace TEXT                The source service or application emitting the
                                  metric that is evaluated by the alarm.
                                  Example: `oci_computeagent` [required]
  --severity TEXT                 The perceived type of response required when
                                  the alarm is in the "FIRING" state.
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `CRITICAL` [required]
  --destinations COMPLEX TYPE     An array of [OCIDs] to which the notifications
                                  for this alarm will be delivered. An example
                                  destination is an OCID for a topic managed by
                                  the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notification
                                  service.
                                  This is a complex type whose value
                                  must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
                                  as a string on the command line or passed in
                                  as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file
                                  syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-param-json-input
                                  option can be used to generate an example of
                                  the JSON which must be provided. We recommend
                                  storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it
                                  as needed and then passing it back in via the
                                  file:// syntax.
                                   [required]
  --is-enabled BOOLEAN            Whether the alarm is enabled.
                                  
                                  Example: `true`
                                  [required]
  --metric-compartment-id-in-subtree BOOLEAN
                                  When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from
                                  all compartments and subcompartments. The
                                  parameter can only be set to true when
                                  metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the
                                  tenancy is the root compartment). A true value
                                  requires the user to have tenancy-level
                                  permissions. If this requirement is not met,
                                  then the call is rejected. When false, the
                                  alarm evaluates metrics from only the
                                  compartment specified in metricCompartmentId.
                                  Default is false.
                                  
                                  Example: `true`
  --resolution TEXT               The time between calculated aggregation
                                  windows for the alarm. Supported value: `1m`
  --pending-duration TEXT         The period of time that the condition defined
                                  in the alarm must persist before the alarm
                                  state changes from "OK" to "FIRING" or vice
                                  versa. For example, a value of 5 minutes means
                                  that the alarm must persist in breaching the
                                  condition for five minutes before the alarm
                                  updates its state to "FIRING"; likewise, the
                                  alarm must persist in not breaching the
                                  condition for five minutes before the alarm
                                  updates its state to "OK."
                                  
                                  The duration is
                                  specified as a string in ISO 8601 format
                                  (`PT10M` for ten minutes or `PT1H` for one
                                  hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H. Default:
                                  PT1M.
                                  
                                  Under the default value of PT1M, the
                                  first evaluation that breaches the alarm
                                  updates the state to "FIRING" and the first
                                  evaluation that does not breach the alarm
                                  updates the state to "OK".
                                  
                                  Example: `PT5M`
  --body TEXT                     The human-readable content of the notification
                                  delivered. Oracle recommends providing
                                  guidance to operators for resolving the alarm
                                  condition. Consider adding links to standard
                                  runbook practices. Avoid entering confidential
                                  information.
                                  
                                  Example: `High CPU usage alert.
                                  Follow runbook instructions for resolution.`
  --repeat-notification-duration TEXT
                                  The frequency at which notifications are re-
                                  submitted, if the alarm keeps firing without
                                  interruption. Format defined by ISO 8601. For
                                  example, `PT4H` indicates four hours. Minimum:
                                  PT1M. Maximum: P30D.
                                  
                                  Default value: null
                                  (notifications are not re-submitted).
                                  Example: `PT2H`
  --suppression COMPLEX TYPE      The configuration details for suppressing an
                                  alarm.
                                  This is a complex type whose value must
                                  be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for
                                  cross-compatibility only. Example:
                                  `{"Department": "Finance"}`
                                  This is a complex
                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
                                  can be provided as a string on the command
                                  line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}`
                                  This is
                                  a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
                                  The value can be provided as a string on the
                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --wait-for-state [ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --query-text TEXT               The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression
                                  to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature
                                  of the Monitoring service interprets results
                                  for each returned time series as Boolean
                                  values, where zero represents false and a non-
                                  zero value represents true. A true value means
                                  that the trigger rule condition has been met.
                                  The query must specify a metric, statistic,
                                  interval, and trigger rule (threshold or
                                  absence). Supported values for interval:
                                  `1m`-`60m` (also `1h`). You can optionally
                                  specify dimensions and grouping functions.
                                  Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`,

                                  root compartment. [required]
  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-
                                  next-page` response header from the previous
                                  "List" call. For important details about how

                                  filter to list an alarm by name.
                                  Alternatively, when you know the alarm OCID,
                                  use the GetAlarm operation.
  --lifecycle-state [ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  A filter to return only alarms that match the
                                  given lifecycle state exactly. When not
                                  specified, only alarms in the ACTIVE lifecycle
                                  state are listed.
  --sort-by [displayName|severity]
                                  The field to use when sorting returned alarm
                                  definitions. Only one sorting level is

                                  Example: `severity`
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use when sorting returned
                                  alarm definitions. Ascending (ASC) or
                                  descending (DESC).
                                  
                                  Example: `ASC`
  --compartment-id-in-subtree BOOLEAN

                                  compartments and subcompartments. The
                                  parameter can only be set to true when
                                  compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy
                                  is the root compartment). A true value
                                  requires the user to have tenancy-level
                                  permissions. If this requirement is not met,
                                  then the call is rejected. When false, returns
                                  resources from only the compartment specified
                                  in compartmentId. Default is false.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.

$ oci monitoring alarm update --help
Usage: oci monitoring alarm update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified alarm.

Options:
  --alarm-id TEXT                 The [OCID] of an alarm. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the alarm. It does
                                  not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
                                  Avoid entering confidential information.
                                  
                                  This
                                  name is sent as the title for notifications
                                  related to this alarm.
                                  
                                  Example: `High CPU
                                  Utilization`
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment containing the
                                  alarm.
  --metric-compartment-id TEXT    The [OCID] of the compartment containing the
                                  metric being evaluated by the alarm.
  --metric-compartment-id-in-subtree BOOLEAN
                                  When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from
                                  all compartments and subcompartments. The
                                  parameter can only be set to true when
                                  metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the
                                  tenancy is the root compartment). A true value
                                  requires the user to have tenancy-level
                                  permissions. If this requirement is not met,
                                  then the call is rejected. When false, the
                                  alarm evaluates metrics from only the
                                  compartment specified in metricCompartmentId.
                                  Default is false.
                                  
                                  Example: `true`
  --namespace TEXT                The source service or application emitting the
                                  metric that is evaluated by the alarm.
                                  Example: `oci_computeagent`
  --resolution TEXT               The time between calculated aggregation
                                  windows for the alarm. Supported value: `1m`
  --pending-duration TEXT         The period of time that the condition defined
                                  in the alarm must persist before the alarm
                                  state changes from "OK" to "FIRING" or vice
                                  versa. For example, a value of 5 minutes means
                                  that the alarm must persist in breaching the
                                  condition for five minutes before the alarm
                                  updates its state to "FIRING"; likewise, the
                                  alarm must persist in not breaching the
                                  condition for five minutes before the alarm
                                  updates its state to "OK."
                                  
                                  The duration is
                                  specified as a string in ISO 8601 format
                                  (`PT10M` for ten minutes or `PT1H` for one
                                  hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H. Default:
                                  PT1M.
                                  
                                  Under the default value of PT1M, the
                                  first evaluation that breaches the alarm
                                  updates the state to "FIRING" and the first
                                  evaluation that does not breach the alarm
                                  updates the state to "OK".
                                  
                                  Example: `PT5M`
  --severity TEXT                 The perceived severity of the alarm with
                                  regard to the affected system.
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `CRITICAL`
  --body TEXT                     The human-readable content of the notification
                                  delivered. Oracle recommends providing
                                  guidance to operators for resolving the alarm
                                  condition. Consider adding links to standard
                                  runbook practices. Avoid entering confidential
                                  information.
                                  
                                  Example: `High CPU usage alert.
                                  Follow runbook instructions for resolution.`
  --destinations COMPLEX TYPE     An array of [OCIDs] to which the notifications
                                  for this alarm will be delivered. An example
                                  destination is an OCID for a topic managed by
                                  the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notification
                                  service.
                                  This is a complex type whose value
                                  must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
                                  as a string on the command line or passed in
                                  as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file
                                  syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-param-json-input
                                  option can be used to generate an example of
                                  the JSON which must be provided. We recommend
                                  storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it
                                  as needed and then passing it back in via the
                                  file:// syntax.
  --repeat-notification-duration TEXT
                                  The frequency at which notifications are re-
                                  submitted, if the alarm keeps firing without
                                  interruption. Format defined by ISO 8601. For
                                  example, `PT4H` indicates four hours. Minimum:
                                  PT1M. Maximum: P30D.
                                  
                                  Default value: null
                                  (notifications are not re-submitted).
                                  Example: `PT2H`
  --suppression COMPLEX TYPE      The configuration details for suppressing an
                                  alarm.
                                  This is a complex type whose value must
                                  be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --is-enabled BOOLEAN            Whether the alarm is enabled.
                                  
                                  Example: `true`
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for
                                  cross-compatibility only. Example:
                                  `{"Department": "Finance"}`
                                  This is a complex
                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
                                  can be provided as a string on the command
                                  line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}`
                                  This is
                                  a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
                                  The value can be provided as a string on the
                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --query-text TEXT               The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression
                                  to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature
                                  of the Monitoring service interprets results
                                  for each returned time series as Boolean
                                  values, where zero represents false and a non-
                                  zero value represents true. A true value means
                                  that the trigger rule condition has been met.
                                  The query must specify a metric, statistic,
                                  interval, and trigger rule (threshold or
                                  absence). Supported values for interval:
                                  `1m`-`60m` (also `1h`). You can optionally
                                  specify dimensions and grouping functions.
                                  Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`,
                                  `groupBy()`. For details about Monitoring
                                  Query Language (MQL), see [Monitoring Query
                                  Language (MQL) Reference]. For available
                                  dimensions, review the metric definition for

  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment containing the
                                  resources monitored by the metric that you are
                                  searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the
                                  root compartment. [required]
  --compartment-id-in-subtree BOOLEAN
                                  When true, returns resources from all
                                  compartments and subcompartments. The
                                  parameter can only be set to true when
                                  compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy
                                  is the root compartment). A true value
                                  requires the user to have tenancy-level
                                  permissions. If this requirement is not met,
                                  then the call is rejected. When false, returns
                                  resources from only the compartment specified
                                  in compartmentId. Default is false.
  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-
                                  next-page` response header from the previous
                                  "List" call. For important details about how
                                  pagination works, see [List Pagination].
  --limit INTEGER                 For list pagination. The maximum number of
                                  results per page, or items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call. 1 is the minimum, 1000
                                  is the maximum. For important details about

                                  Default: 1000
                                  
                                  Example: 500
  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly. Use this
                                  filter to list an alarm by name.
                                  Alternatively, when you know the alarm OCID,
                                  use the GetAlarm operation.
  --sort-by [displayName|severity]
                                  The field to use when sorting returned alarm
                                  definitions. Only one sorting level is

  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON

                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.

                                  provided.
                                  
                                  Example: `NAMESPACE`
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use when sorting returned
                                  metric definitions. Ascending (ASC) or
                                  descending (DESC).
                                  
                                  Example: `ASC`
  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-
                                  next-page` response header from the previous
                                  "List" call. For important details about how
                                  pagination works, see [List Pagination].
  --limit INTEGER                 For list pagination. The maximum number of
                                  results per page, or items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call. 1 is the minimum, 1000
                                  is the maximum. For important details about
                                  how pagination works, see [List Pagination].
                                  Default: 1000

  --compartment-id-in-subtree BOOLEAN
                                  When true, returns resources from all
                                  compartments and subcompartments. The
                                  parameter can only be set to true when
                                  compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy
                                  is the root compartment). A true value
                                  requires the user to have tenancy-level
                                  permissions. If this requirement is not met,
                                  then the call is rejected. When false, returns
                                  resources from only the compartment specified
                                  in compartmentId. Default is false.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

$ oci monitoring metric-data post --help
Usage: oci monitoring metric-data post [OPTIONS]

  Publishes raw metric data points to the Monitoring service. For more
  information about publishing metrics, see [Publishing Custom Metrics].

  The endpoints for this operation differ from other Monitoring operations.
  Replace the string `telemetry` with `telemetry-ingestion` in the endpoint,
  as in the following example:

  https://telemetry-ingestion.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com

Options:
  --metric-data COMPLEX TYPE      A metric object containing raw metric data
                                  points to be posted to the Monitoring service.
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this

                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
                                   [required]
  --batch-atomicity [ATOMIC|NON_ATOMIC]
                                  Batch atomicity behavior. Requires either
                                  partial or full pass of input validation for
                                  metric objects in PostMetricData requests. The
                                  default value of NON_ATOMIC requires a partial
                                  pass: at least one metric object in the
                                  request must pass input validation, and any
                                  objects that failed validation are identified
                                  in the returned summary, along with their
                                  error messages. A value of ATOMIC requires a
                                  full pass: all metric objects in the request
                                  must pass input validation.
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `NON_ATOMIC`
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and

                                  minute to retrieve five-minute aggregations at
