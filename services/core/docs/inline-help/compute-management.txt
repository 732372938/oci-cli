           [OPTIONS]

  Change the compartment of a cluster network.

Options:
  --cluster-network-id TEXT  The OCID of the cluster network. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment into which the
                             resource should be moved. [required]
  --if-match TEXT            For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or
                             DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-match`
                             parameter to the value of the etag from a previous
                             GET or POST response for that resource.  The
                             resource will be updated or deleted only if the
                             etag you provide matches the resource's current
                             etag value.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                             The --generate-full-command-json-input option can
                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                             need to be populated by the user before using the
                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.
                             
                             Options can
                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.

$ oci compute-management instance-configuration change-compartment --help
Usage: oci compute-management instance-configuration change-compartment 
           [OPTIONS]

  Moves an instance configuration into a different compartment within the same
  tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see
  [Moving Resources to a Different Compartment].

  When you move an instance configuration to a different compartment,
  associated resources such as instance pools are not moved.

  **Important:** Most of the properties for an existing instance
  configuration, including the compartment, cannot be modified after you
  create the instance configuration. Although you can move an instance
  configuration to a different compartment, you will not be able to use the
  instance configuration to manage instance pools in the new compartment. If
  you want to update an instance configuration to point to a different
  compartment, you should instead create a new instance configuration in the
  target compartment using [CreateInstanceConfiguration].

Options:
  --instance-configuration-id TEXT
                                  The OCID of the instance configuration.
                                  [required]

Usage: oci compute-management instance-configuration list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the instance configurations in the specified compartment.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment. [required]
  --limit INTEGER                 For list pagination. The maximum number of
                                  results per page, or items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call. For important details
                                  about how pagination works, see [List
                                  Pagination].
                                  
                                  Example: `50`
  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-
                                  next-page` response header from the previous
                                  "List" call. For important details about how
                                  pagination works, see [List Pagination].
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

$ oci compute-management instance-pool change-compartment --help
Usage: oci compute-management instance-pool change-compartment 
           [OPTIONS]

  Moves an instance pool into a different compartment within the same tenancy.
  For information about moving resources between compartments, see [Moving
  Resources to a Different Compartment].

  When you move an instance pool to a different compartment, associated
  resources such as the instances in the pool, boot volumes, VNICs, and
  autoscaling configurations are not moved.

Options:
  --instance-pool-id TEXT    The OCID of the instance pool. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment to move the instance
                             pool to. [required]
  --if-match TEXT            For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or
                             DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-match`
                             parameter to the value of the etag from a previous
                             GET or POST response for that resource.  The
                             resource will be updated or deleted only if the
                             etag you provide matches the resource's current
                             etag value.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.

                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to

  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --lifecycle-state [PROVISIONING|SCALING|STARTING|STOPPING|TERMINATING|STOPPED|TERMINATED|RUNNING]
                                  A filter to only return resources that match
                                  the given lifecycle state.  The state value is
                                  case-insensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.

$ oci compute-management instance-pool list-instances --help
Usage: oci compute-management instance-pool list-instances [OPTIONS]

  List the instances in the specified instance pool.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment. [required]
  --instance-pool-id TEXT         The OCID of the instance pool. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A filter to return only resources that match
                                  the given display name exactly.
  --limit INTEGER                 For list pagination. The maximum number of
                                  results per page, or items to return in a
                                  paginated "List" call. For important details
                                  about how pagination works, see [List
                                  Pagination].
                                  
                                  Example: `50`
  --page TEXT                     For list pagination. The value of the `opc-
                                  next-page` response header from the previous
                                  "List" call. For important details about how
                                  pagination works, see [List Pagination].
  --sort-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
                                  The field to sort by. You can provide one sort
                                  order (`sortOrder`). Default order for
                                  TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for
                                  DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort
                                  order is case sensitive.
                                  
                                  **Note:** In
                                  general, some "List" operations (for example,
                                  `ListInstances`) let you optionally filter by
                                  availability domain if the scope of the
                                  resource type is within a single availability
                                  domain. If you call one of these "List"
                                  operations without specifying an availability
                                  domain, the resources are grouped by
                                  availability domain, then sorted.
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]         The sort order to use, either ascending
                                  (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`). The
                                  DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
  --all                           Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                  this option, then you cannot provide the
                                  --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER             When fetching results, the number of results
                                  to fetch per call. Only valid when used with
                                  --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->

                                  To use the instance
                                  pool with a regional subnet, provide a
                                  placement configuration for each availability
                                  domain, and include the regional subnet in
                                  each placement configuration.

                                  This is a
                                  complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
                                  The value can be provided as a string on the
                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the

                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --size INTEGER                  The number of instances that should be in the
                                  instance pool.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|SCALING|STARTING|STOPPING|TERMINATING|STOPPED|TERMINATED|RUNNING]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
