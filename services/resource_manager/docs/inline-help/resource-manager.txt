$ oci resource-manager job --help
Usage: oci resource-manager job [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Jobs perform the actions that are defined in your configuration. There are
  three job types - **Plan job**. A plan job takes your Terraform
  configuration, parses it, and creates an execution plan. - **Apply job**.
  The apply job takes your execution plan, applies it to the associated stack,
  then executes the configuration's instructions. - **Destroy job**. To clean
  up the infrastructure controlled by the stack, you run a destroy job. A
  destroy job does not delete the stack or associated job resources, but
  instead releases the resources managed by the stack. - **Import_TF_State
  job**. An import Terraform state job takes a Terraform state file and sets
  it as the current state of the stack. This is used to migrate local
  Terraform environments to Resource Manager.

$ oci resource-manager job cancel --help
Usage: oci resource-manager job cancel [OPTIONS]

  Indicates the intention to cancel the specified job. Cancellation of the job
  is not immediate, and may be delayed, or may not happen at all.

Options:
  --job-id TEXT                   The job OCID. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource.  The resource will be updated
                                  or deleted only if the etag you provide
                                  matches the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the

  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys

                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.

  of 100,000 log entries.

Options:
  --job-id TEXT     The job OCID. [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file
                    using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                    
                    The --generate-full-
                    command-json-input option can be used to generate a sample
                    json file to be used with this command option. The key names
                    are pre-populated and match the command option names
                    (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                    compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be
                    populated by the user before using the sample file as an
                    input to this command. For any command option that accepts
                    multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                    Options can still be provided on the command line. If an
                    option exists in both the JSON document and the command line

                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is

$ oci resource-manager stack change-compartment --help
Usage: oci resource-manager stack change-compartment [OPTIONS]

  Moves a Stack and it's associated Jobs into a different compartment.

Options:
  --stack-id TEXT                 The stack OCID. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment into which the
                                  Stack should be moved. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource.  The resource will be updated
                                  or deleted only if the etag you provide
                                  matches the resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

Usage: oci resource-manager stack delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the specified stack object.

Options:
  --stack-id TEXT                 The stack OCID. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource.  The resource will be updated
                                  or deleted only if the etag you provide
                                  matches the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource.  The resource will be updated
                                  or deleted only if the etag you provide
                                  matches the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --config-source TEXT            A Terraform configuration .zip file.
  --working-directory TEXT        The path of the directory from which to run
                                  terraform. If not specified the root will be
                                  used.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command

                             Pagination].
  --page TEXT                The value of the `opc-next-page` response header
                             from the preceding `List` call. For information
                             about pagination, see [List Pagination].
  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]    The sort order, either `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC`
                             (descending).
  --all                      Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                             option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER        When fetching results, the number of results to
                             fetch per call. Only valid when used with --all or
                             --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                             The --generate-full-command-json-input option can
                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                             need to be populated by the user before using the
                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.
                             
                             Options can
                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.
