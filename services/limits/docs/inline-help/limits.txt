$ oci limits quota --help
Usage: oci limits quota [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Quotas are applied on top of the service limits and inherited through the
  nested compartment hierarchy. They allow compartment admins to limit
  resource consumption and set boundaries around acceptable resource use. The
  word "quota" is used by people in different ways:   * An individual
  statement written in the declarative language   * A collection of statements
  in a single, named "quota" object (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID)
  assigned to it)   * The overall body of quotas your organization uses to
  control access to resources

  --sort-order [ASC|DESC]       The sort order to use, either 'asc' or 'desc'.
  --sort-by [NAME|TIMECREATED]  The field to sort by. Only one sort order may be
                                provided. Time created is default ordered as
                                descending. Display name is default ordered as
                                ascending.
  --all                         Fetches all pages of results. If you provide
                                this option, then you cannot provide the --limit
                                option.
  --page-size INTEGER           When fetching results, the number of results to
                                fetch per call. Only valid when used with --all
                                or --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT              Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                                from a file using the file://path-to/file
                                syntax.
                                
                                The --generate-full-command-json-input
                                option can be used to generate a sample json
                                file to be used with this command option. The
                                key names are pre-populated and match the
                                command option names (converted to camelCase
                                format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId),
                                while the values of the keys need to be
                                populated by the user before using the sample
                                file as an input to this command. For any
                                command option that accepts multiple values, the
                                value of the key can be a JSON array.
                                
                                Options
                                can still be provided on the command line. If an
                                option exists in both the JSON document and the
                                command line then the command line specified
                                value will be used.
                                
                                For examples on usage of
                                this option, please see our "using CLI with

                                  whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
                                  be provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then

                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
                                  can be provided as a string on the command
                                  line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to

                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Defined tags for this resource. Each key is
                                  predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more
                                  information, see [Resource Tags]. Example:
                                  `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}`
                                  This is
                                  a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
                                  The value can be provided as a string on the
                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACTIVE]       This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a
                                  return code of 2 is returned. For any other
                                  error, a return code of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
                                  For examples on usage of this option, please
