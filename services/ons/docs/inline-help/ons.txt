$ oci ons topic create --help
Usage: oci ons topic create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a topic in the specified compartment. For general information about
  topics, see [Managing Topics and Subscriptions].

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the topic to reside. For information about access
  control and compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  You must specify a display name for the topic.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including topics, get an Oracle-
  assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you
  create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
  type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see
  [Resource Identifiers].

Options:
  --name TEXT                   The name of the topic being created. Avoid
                                entering confidential information. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT     The [OCID] of the compartment to create the
                                topic in. [required]

  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE  Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a
                                simple key-value pair with no predefined name,
                                type, or namespace. For more information, see
                                [Resource Tags].
                                
                                Example: `{"Department":
                                "Finance"}`
                                This is a complex type whose value
                                must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as
                                a string on the command line or passed in as a
                                file using

                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
                                  For examples on usage of this option, please

Usage: oci ons topic update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the specified topic's configuration.

Options:
  --topic-id TEXT               The [OCID] of the topic to update. [required]
  --description TEXT            The description of the topic. Avoid entering
                                confidential information. [required]
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE  Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a
                                simple key-value pair with no predefined name,
                                type, or namespace. For more information, see
                                [Resource Tags].
                                
                                Example: `{"Department":
                                "Finance"}`
                                This is a complex type whose value
                                must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as
                                a string on the command line or passed in as a
                                file using
                                the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                
                                The
                                --generate-param-json-input option can be used
                                to generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                provided. We recommend storing this example
                                in a
                                file, modifying it as needed and then passing it
                                back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE   Defined tags for this resource. Each key is
                                predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more
                                information, see [Resource Tags].
                                
                                Example:
                                `{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}`
                                This is a
                                complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
                                value can be provided as a string on the command
                                line or passed in as a file using
                                the
                                file://path/to/file syntax.
                                
                                The --generate-
                                param-json-input option can be used to generate
                                an example of the JSON which must be provided.
                                We recommend storing this example
                                in a file,
                                modifying it as needed and then passing it back
                                in via the file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT               Used for optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                match` parameter to the value of the etag from a
                                previous GET or POST response for that resource.
                                The resource will be updated or deleted only if
                                the etag you provide matches the resource's
                                current etag value.
  --force                       Perform update without prompting for
                                confirmation.
  --from-json TEXT              Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                                from a file using the file://path-to/file
                                syntax.
                                
                                The --generate-full-command-json-input
                                option can be used to generate a sample json
                                file to be used with this command option. The
                                key names are pre-populated and match the
                                command option names (converted to camelCase
                                format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId),
                                while the values of the keys need to be
                                populated by the user before using the sample
                                file as an input to this command. For any
                                command option that accepts multiple values, the
                                value of the key can be a JSON array.
                                
                                Options
                                can still be provided on the command line. If an
                                option exists in both the JSON document and the
                                command line then the command line specified
                                value will be used.
                                
                                For examples on usage of
                                this option, please see our "using CLI with
                                advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.
