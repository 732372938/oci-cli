Usage: oci integration integration-instance change-compartment 
           [OPTIONS]

  Change the compartment for an integration instance

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       Compartment Identifier.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --id TEXT                       Unique Integration Instance identifier.
                                  [required]
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

Usage: oci integration integration-instance create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new Integration Instance.

Options:
  --display-name TEXT             Integration Instance Identifier. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       Compartment Identifier. [required]
  --is-byol BOOLEAN               Bring your own license. [required]
  --message-packs INTEGER         The number of configured message packs
                                  [required]
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for
                                  cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-
                                  key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.

                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "value"}}`

                                  is a complex type whose value must be valid
                                  JSON. The value can be provided as a string on
                                  the command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The
                                  --generate-param-json-input option can be used
                                  to generate an example of the JSON which must
                                  be provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --idcs-at TEXT                  IDCS Authentication token. This is is required
                                  for pre-UCPIS cloud accounts, but not UCPIS,
                                  hence not a required parameter
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,

                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has

WARNING: Python 2 support is ending on December 31, 2019. Future versions of OCI CLI after January 2020, will not be compatible with Python 2. To avoid interruption at that time, please install OCI CLI in a compatible Python 3 environment.
Usage: oci integration integration-instance update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the Integration Instance.

Options:
  --display-name TEXT             Integration Instance Identifier.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for
                                  cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-
                                  key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "value"}}`
                                  This
                                  is a complex type whose value must be valid
                                  JSON. The value can be provided as a string on
                                  the command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The
                                  --generate-param-json-input option can be used
                                  to generate an example of the JSON which must
                                  be provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --is-byol BOOLEAN               Bring your own license.
  --message-packs INTEGER         The number of configured message packs
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --id TEXT                       Unique Integration Instance identifier.
                                  [required]
  --type [STANDARD|ENTERPRISE]    Standard or Enterprise type
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
