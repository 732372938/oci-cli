$ oci waas access-rule list --help
Usage: oci waas access-rule list [OPTIONS]

  Gets the currently configured access rules for the Web Application Firewall
  configuration of a specified WAAS policy. The order of the access rules is
  important. The rules will be checked in the order they are specified and the
  first matching rule will be used.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --limit INTEGER        The maximum number of items to return in a paginated
                         call. In unspecified, defaults to `10`.
  --page TEXT            The value of the `opc-next-page` response header from
                         the previous paginated call.
  --all                  Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                         option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER    When fetching results, the number of results to fetch
                         per call. Only valid when used with --all or --limit,
                         and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT       Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a
                         file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                         
                         The
                         --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used
                         to generate a sample json file to be used with this
                         command option. The key names are pre-populated and
                         match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                         format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                         the values of the keys need to be populated by the user
                         before using the sample file as an input to this
                         command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                         values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                         Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                         an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                         command line then the command line specified value will
                         be used.
                         
                         For examples on usage of this option, please

$ oci waas access-rule update --help
Usage: oci waas access-rule update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the list of access rules in the Web Application Firewall
  configuration for a specified WAAS policy. Access rules allow explicit
  actions to be defined and executed for requests that meet various
  conditions. A rule action can be set to allow, detect, or block requests.
  The detect setting allows the request to pass through the Web Application
  Firewall and is tagged with a `DETECT` flag in the Web Application
  Firewall's log.

  This operation can create, delete, update, and/or reorder access rules
  depending on the structure of the request body.

  Access rules can be updated by changing the properties of the access rule
  object with the rule's key specified in the key field. Access rules can be
  reordered by changing the order of the access rules in the list when
  updating.

  Access rules can be created by adding a new access rule object to the list
  without a `key` property specified. A `key` will be generated for the new
  access rule upon update.

  Any existing access rules that are not specified with a `key` in the list of
  access rules will be deleted upon update.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --access-rules COMPLEX TYPE     This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
                                   [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

                             generated when the address list is added to the
                             compartment. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment into which the
                             resource should be moved. [required]
  --if-match TEXT            For optimistic concurrency control. In the `PUT` or
                             `DELETE` call for a resource, set the `if-match`
                             parameter to the value of the etag from a previous
                             `GET` or `POST` response for that resource. The
                             resource will be updated or deleted only if the
                             etag provided matches the resource's current etag
                             value.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.

                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys

$ oci waas address-rate-limiting update-waf --help
Usage: oci waas address-rate-limiting update-waf [OPTIONS]

  Updates the address rate limiting settings in the Web Application Firewall
  configuration for a policy. Rate limiting allows you to configure a
  threshold for the number of requests from a unique IP address for the given
  period. You can also define the response code for the requests from the same
  address that exceed the threshold.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --is-enabled BOOLEAN            Enables or disables the address rate limiting
                                  Web Application Firewall feature. [required]
  --allowed-rate-per-address INTEGER
                                  The number of allowed requests per second from
                                  one IP address. If unspecified, defaults to
                                  `1`.
  --max-delayed-count-per-address INTEGER
                                  The maximum number of requests allowed to be
                                  queued before subsequent requests are dropped.
                                  If unspecified, defaults to `10`.
  --block-response-code INTEGER   The response status code returned when a
                                  request is blocked. If unspecified, defaults
                                  to `503`.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a

                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.

$ oci waas captcha list --help
Usage: oci waas captcha list [OPTIONS]

  Gets the list of currently configured CAPTCHA challenges in the Web
  Application Firewall configuration of a WAAS policy.

  The order of the CAPTCHA challenges is important. The URL for each CAPTCHA
  will be checked in the order they are created.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --limit INTEGER        The maximum number of items to return in a paginated
                         call. In unspecified, defaults to `10`.
  --page TEXT            The value of the `opc-next-page` response header from
                         the previous paginated call.
  --all                  Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                         option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER    When fetching results, the number of results to fetch
                         per call. Only valid when used with --all or --limit,
                         and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT       Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a
                         file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                         
                         The
                         --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used
                         to generate a sample json file to be used with this
                         command option. The key names are pre-populated and
                         match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                         format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                         the values of the keys need to be populated by the user
                         before using the sample file as an input to this
                         command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                         values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                         Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                         an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                         command line then the command line specified value will
                         be used.
                         
                         For examples on usage of this option, please

$ oci waas captcha update --help
Usage: oci waas captcha update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the list of CAPTCHA challenges in the Web Application Firewall
  configuration for a WAAS policy. This operation can create, update, or
  delete CAPTCHAs depending on the structure of the request body. CAPTCHA
  challenges can be updated by changing the properties of the CAPTCHA object
  with the rule's key specified in the key field. CAPTCHA challenges can be
  reordered by changing the order of the CAPTCHA challenges in the list when
  updating.

  CAPTCHA challenges can be created by adding a new access rule object to the
  list without a `key` property specified. A `key` will be generated for the
  new CAPTCHA challenges upon update.

  Any existing CAPTCHA challenges that are not specified with a `key` in the
  list of CAPTCHA challenges will be deleted upon update.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --captchas COMPLEX TYPE         A list of CAPTCHA details.
                                  This is a complex
                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
                                  can be provided as a string on the command
                                  line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
                                  [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

$ oci waas certificate change-compartment --help
Usage: oci waas certificate change-compartment [OPTIONS]

  Moves certificate into a different compartment. When provided, If-Match is
  checked against ETag values of the certificate.

Options:
  --certificate-id TEXT      The [OCID] of the SSL certificate used in the WAAS
                             policy. This number is generated when the
                             certificate is added to the policy. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment into which the
                             resource should be moved. [required]
  --if-match TEXT            For optimistic concurrency control. In the `PUT` or
                             `DELETE` call for a resource, set the `if-match`
                             parameter to the value of the etag from a previous
                             `GET` or `POST` response for that resource. The
                             resource will be updated or deleted only if the
                             etag provided matches the resource's current etag
                             value.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                             The --generate-full-command-json-input option can
                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys

                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.
                             
                             Options can
                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.

$ oci waas certificate create --help
Usage: oci waas certificate create [OPTIONS]

  Allows an SSL certificate to be added to a WAAS policy. The Web Application
  Firewall terminates SSL connections to inspect requests in runtime, and then
  re-encrypts requests before sending them to the origin for fulfillment.

  For more information, see [WAF Settings].

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment in which to
                                  create the SSL certificate. [required]
  --certificate-data TEXT         The data of the SSL certificate.
                                  
                                  **Note:**
                                  Many SSL certificate providers require an
                                  intermediate certificate chain to ensure a
                                  trusted status. If your SSL certificate
                                  requires an intermediate certificate chain,
                                  please append the intermediate certificate key
                                  in the `certificateData` field after the leaf
                                  certificate issued by the SSL certificate
                                  provider. If you are unsure if your
                                  certificate requires an intermediate
                                  certificate chain, see your certificate
                                  provider's documentation.
                                  
                                  The example below
                                  shows an intermediate certificate appended to
                                  a leaf certificate. [required]
  --private-key-data TEXT         The private key of the SSL certificate.
                                  [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the SSL certificate.
                                  The name can be changed and does not need to
                                  be unique.
  --is-trust-verification-disabled BOOLEAN
                                  Set to `true` if the SSL certificate is self-
                                  signed.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is
                                  a simple key-value pair with no predefined
                                  name, type, or namespace. For more
                                  information, see [Resource Tags].
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `{"Department": "Finance"}`
                                  This is a complex
                                  type whose value must be valid JSON. The value
                                  can be provided as a string on the command
                                  line or passed in as a file using
                                  the

$ oci waas certificate update --help
Usage: oci waas certificate update [OPTIONS]

  It is not possible to update a certificate, only create and delete.
  Therefore, this operation can only update the display name, freeform tags,
  and defined tags of a certificate.

Options:
  --certificate-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the SSL certificate used in the
                                  WAAS policy. This number is generated when the
                                  certificate is added to the policy. [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the SSL certificate.
                                  The name can be changed and does not need to
                                  be unique.
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is
                                  a simple key-value pair with no predefined
                                  name, type, or namespace. For more
                                  information, see [Resource Tags].
                                  
                                  Example:
                                  `{"Department": "Finance"}`

                                  can be provided as a string on the command

                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|FAILED|UPDATING|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform deletion without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|FAILED|UPDATING|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.

  --custom-protection-rule-id TEXT
                                  The [OCID] of the Custom Protection rule. This
                                  number is generated when the Custom Protection
                                  rule is added to the compartment. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the Custom Protection
                                  rule.
  --description TEXT              A description for the Custom Protection rule.
  --template TEXT                 The template text of the Custom Protection
                                  rule. The syntax is based on ModSecurity Rule
                                  Language. Additionaly it needs to include two
                                  variables / placeholders which will be
                                  replaced during publishing.

                                  unique rule ID which identifies a `SecRule`,
                                  generated by the system. Multiple IDs can be
                                  used by increasing the number of the variable
                                  for every `SecRule` defined in the template.
                                  *Example usage:*   ```   SecRule

                                  \           deny"   ```   The example contains
                                  two `SecRules` each having distinct regex
                                  expression to match   `Cookie` header value
                                  during second input analysis phase.   The
                                  disruptive `deny` action takes effect only
                                  when `{{mode}}` is set to `BLOCK`.   The
                                  message is logged either when `{{mode}}` is
                                  set to `DETECT` or `BLOCK`.

                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for

  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|FAILED|UPDATING|DELETING|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.

$ oci waas device-fingerprint-challenge update --help
Usage: oci waas device-fingerprint-challenge update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the Device Fingerprint Challenge (DFC) settings in the Web
  Application Firewall configuration for a policy. The DFC generates a hashed
  signature of both virtual and real browsers based on 50+ attributes. These
  proprietary signatures are then leveraged for real-time correlation to
  identify and block malicious bots.

  The signature is based on a library of attributes detected via JavaScript
  listeners; the attributes include OS, screen resolution, fonts, UserAgent,
  IP address, etc. We are constantly making improvements and considering new
  libraries to include in our DFC build. We can also exclude attributes from
  the signature as needed.

  DFC collects attributes to generate a hashed signature about a client – if a
  fingerprint is not possible, then it will result in a block or alert action.
  Actions can be enforced across multiple devices if they share they have the
  same fingerprint.

                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.

                                  syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a

                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.

                                  syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

                                  not connect directly to us.
  --client-address-header [X_FORWARDED_FOR|X_CLIENT_IP|X_REAL_IP|CLIENT_IP|TRUE_CLIENT_IP]
                                  The HTTP header used to pass the client IP
                                  address from the CDN if `isBehindCdn` is
                                  enabled. This feature consumes the header and
                                  its value as the true client IP address. It
                                  does not create the header. Using trusted
                                  chains (for example `X-Client-Ip: 11.1.1.1,
                                  13.3.3.3`), the last IP address in the list
                                  will be used as true client IP address. In
                                  case of multiple headers with the same name,
                                  the first one will be used. If the header is
                                  not present it will use the connecting IP
                                  address as the true client IP address. It's
                                  assumed that CDN sets the correct client IP
                                  address and prevents spoofing.

                                  based on the response `cache-control` header.
                                  This feature enables the origin to act as a
                                  proxy cache. Caching policies are usually
                                  defined using `cache-control` header. For
                                  example `cache-control: max-age=120` means
                                  that the returned resource is valid for 120
                                  seconds. Caching rules will overwrite this
                                  setting.
  --is-response-buffering-enabled BOOLEAN
                                  Enable or disable buffering of responses from
                                  the origin. Buffering improves overall
                                  stability in case of network issues, but

  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request

                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.

$ oci waas protection-rule update --help
Usage: oci waas protection-rule update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the action for each specified protection rule. Requests can either
  be allowed, blocked, or trigger an alert if they meet the parameters of an
  applied rule. For more information on protection rules, see [WAF Protection
  Rules]. This operation can update or disable protection rules depending on
  the structure of the request body. Protection rules can be updated by
  changing the properties of the protection rule object with the rule's key
  specified in the key field.

                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

$ oci waas protection-settings update --help
Usage: oci waas protection-settings update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the protection settings in the Web Application Firewall
  configuration for a WAAS policy. Protection settings allow you define what
  action is taken when a request is blocked by the Web Application Firewall,
  such as returning a response code or block page. Only the fields specified
  in the request body will be updated; all other fields will remain unchanged.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --block-action [SHOW_ERROR_PAGE|SET_RESPONSE_CODE]
                                  If `action` is set to `BLOCK`, this specifies

                                  "Values Limits" rule (key: 960208).
  --max-total-name-length-of-arguments INTEGER
                                  The maximum length allowed for the sum of the
                                  argument name and value, in characters.
                                  Arguements are query parameters or body

                                  command line or passed in as a file using
                                  the
                                  file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-
                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work

                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is

  Updates the action to take when a request's IP address matches an address in
  the specified threat intelligence feed. Threat intelligence feeds are
  compiled lists of IP addresses with malicious reputations based on internet
  intelligence. Only the threat feeds specified in the request body will be
  updated; all other threat feeds will remain unchanged.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --threat-feeds COMPLEX TYPE     A list of threat feeds for which to update the
                                  actions.
                                  This is a complex type whose value
                                  must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
                                  as a string on the command line or passed in
                                  as a file using

                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER

$ oci waas waas-policy change-compartment --help
Usage: oci waas waas-policy change-compartment [OPTIONS]

  Moves WAAS policy into a different compartment. When provided, If-Match is
  checked against ETag values of the WAAS policy.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT      The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment into which the
                             resource should be moved. [required]
  --if-match TEXT            For optimistic concurrency control. In the `PUT` or
                             `DELETE` call for a resource, set the `if-match`
                             parameter to the value of the etag from a previous
                             `GET` or `POST` response for that resource. The
                             resource will be updated or deleted only if the
                             etag provided matches the resource's current etag
                             value.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                             The --generate-full-command-json-input option can
                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                             need to be populated by the user before using the
                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.
                             
                             Options can
                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.
                             
                             For examples on usage of this option, please

$ oci waas waas-policy create --help
Usage: oci waas waas-policy create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy in the
  specified compartment. A WAAS policy must be established before creating Web
  Application Firewall (WAF) rules. To use WAF rules, your web application's
  origin servers must defined in the `WaasPolicy` schema.

  A domain name must be specified when creating a WAAS policy. The domain name
  should be different from the origins specified in your `WaasPolicy`. Once
  domain name is entered and stored, it is unchangeable.

  Use the record data returned in the `cname` field of the `WaasPolicy` object
  to create a CNAME record in your DNS configuration that will direct your
  domain's traffic through the WAF.

  For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
  compartment where you want the service to reside. For information about
  access control and compartments, see [Overview of the IAM Service].

  You must specify a display name and domain for the WAAS policy. The display
  name does not have to be unique and can be changed. The domain name should
  be different from every origin specified in `WaasPolicy`.

  All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including WAAS policies, receive
  a unique, Oracle-assigned ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When
  a resource is created, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also
  retrieve a resource's OCID by using a list API operation for that resource
  type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see
  [Resource Identifiers].

  **Note:** After sending the POST request, the new object's state will
  temporarily be `CREATING`. Ensure that the resource's state has changed to
  `ACTIVE` before use.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT       The [OCID] of the compartment in which to
                                  create the WAAS policy. [required]
  --domain TEXT                   The web application domain that the WAAS
                                  policy protects. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the WAAS policy. The
                                  name can be changed and does not need to be
                                  unique.

                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.

$ oci waas waas-policy update --help
Usage: oci waas waas-policy update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the details of a WAAS policy, including origins and tags. Only the
  fields specified in the request body will be updated; all other properties
  will remain unchanged. To update platform provided resources such as
  `GoodBots`, `ProtectionRules`, and `ThreatFeeds`, first retrieve the list of
  available resources with the related list operation such as `GetThreatFeeds`
  or `GetProtectionRules`. The returned list will contain objects with `key`
  properties that can be used to update the resource during the
  `UpdateWaasPolicy` request.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --display-name TEXT             A user-friendly name for the WAAS policy. The
                                  name can be changed and does not need to be
                                  unique.
  --additional-domains COMPLEX TYPE
                                  An array of additional domains protected by

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

                         match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                         format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                         the values of the keys need to be populated by the user
                         before using the sample file as an input to this
                         command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                         values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                         Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                         an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                         command line then the command line specified value will
                         be used.

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

$ oci waas whitelist list --help
Usage: oci waas whitelist list [OPTIONS]

  Gets the list of whitelists defined in the Web Application Firewall
  configuration for a WAAS policy.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --limit INTEGER        The maximum number of items to return in a paginated
                         call. In unspecified, defaults to `10`.
  --page TEXT            The value of the `opc-next-page` response header from
                         the previous paginated call.
  --all                  Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                         option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER    When fetching results, the number of results to fetch
                         per call. Only valid when used with --all or --limit,
                         and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT       Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a
                         file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                         
                         The
                         --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used
                         to generate a sample json file to be used with this
                         command option. The key names are pre-populated and
                         match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                         format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                         the values of the keys need to be populated by the user
                         before using the sample file as an input to this
                         command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                         values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                         Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                         an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                         command line then the command line specified value will
                         be used.

$ oci waas whitelist update --help
Usage: oci waas whitelist update [OPTIONS]

  Updates the list of IP addresses that bypass the Web Application Firewall
  for a WAAS policy. Supports both single IP addresses or subnet masks (CIDR
  notation).

  This operation can create, delete, update, and/or reorder whitelists
  depending on the structure of the request body.

  Whitelists can be updated by changing the properties of the whitelist object
  with the rule's key specified in the `key` field. Whitelists can be
  reordered by changing the order of the whitelists in the list of objects
  when updating.

  Whitelists can be created by adding a new whitelist object to the list
  without a `key` property specified. A `key` will be generated for the new
  whitelist upon update.

  Whitelists can be deleted by removing the existing whitelist object from the
  list. Any existing whitelists that are not specified with a `key` in the
  list of access rules will be deleted upon update.

Options:
  --waas-policy-id TEXT           The [OCID] of the WAAS policy. [required]
  --whitelists COMPLEX TYPE       This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
                                   [required]
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the
                                  `PUT` or `DELETE` call for a resource, set the
                                  `if-match` parameter to the value of the etag
                                  from a previous `GET` or `POST` response for
                                  that resource. The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag provided matches the
                                  resource's current etag value.
  --wait-for-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
                                  This operation asynchronously creates,
                                  modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work
                                  request to track the progress of the
                                  operation. Specify this option to perform the
                                  action and then wait until the work request
                                  reaches a certain state. Multiple states can
                                  be specified, returning on the first state.
                                  For example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED
                                  --wait-for-state FAILED would return on
                                  whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If
                                  timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is
                                  returned. For any other error, a return code
                                  of 1 is returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the work request
                                  to reach the state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the work request to see if it has
                                  reached the state defined by --wait-for-state.
                                  Defaults to 30 seconds.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and

                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
