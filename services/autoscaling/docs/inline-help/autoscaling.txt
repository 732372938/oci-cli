$ oci autoscaling configuration change-compartment --help
Usage: oci autoscaling configuration change-compartment [OPTIONS]

  Moves an autoscaling configuration into a different compartment within the
  same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments,
  see [Moving Resources to a Different Compartment].

  When you move an autoscaling configuration to a different compartment,
  associated resources such as instance pools are not moved.

Options:
  --auto-scaling-configuration-id TEXT
                                  The [OCID] of the autoscaling configuration.

  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-

                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.

  --cool-down-in-seconds INTEGER  The minimum period of time to wait between
                                  scaling actions. The cooldown period gives the
                                  system time to stabilize before rescaling. The
                                  minimum value is 300 seconds, which is also
                                  the default.
  --is-enabled BOOLEAN            Whether the autoscaling configuration is

  --is-enabled BOOLEAN            Whether the autoscaling configuration is
                                  enabled.
  --cool-down-in-seconds INTEGER  The minimum period of time to wait between
                                  scaling actions. The cooldown period gives the
                                  system time to stabilize before rescaling. The
                                  minimum value is 300 seconds, which is also
                                  the default.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-

                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.

                                  must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
                                  as a string on the command line or passed in

                                  syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-param-json-input
                                  option can be used to generate an example of
                                  the JSON which must be provided. We recommend
                                  storing this example
                                  in a file, modifying it
                                  as needed and then passing it back in via the
                                  file:// syntax.
  --if-match TEXT                 For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT
                                  or DELETE call for a resource, set the `if-
                                  match` parameter to the value of the etag from
                                  a previous GET or POST response for that
                                  resource.  The resource will be updated or
                                  deleted only if the etag you provide matches
                                  the resource's current etag value.
  --force                         Perform update without prompting for
                                  confirmation.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using
                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.
