                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "foo-value"}}`
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and

  --wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|INACTIVE|DELETED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.

Usage: oci dts job create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new transfer disk or appliance job.

Options:
  --wait-for-state [INITIATED|PREPARING|ACTIVE|DELETED|CLOSED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.

  --display-name TEXT             Job display name [required]
  --device-type [DISK|APPLIANCE]  Transfer device type [required]
  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without
                                  any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for
                                  cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-
                                  key": "value"}`
                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using

                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "foo-value"}}`
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be
                                  valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and

                                  syntax.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-

WARNING: Python 2 support is ending on December 31, 2019. Future versions of OCI CLI after January 2020, will not be compatible with Python 2. To avoid interruption at that time, please install OCI CLI in a compatible Python 3 environment.
Usage: oci dts job delete [OPTIONS]

  Deletes the transfer disk or appliance job.

Options:
  --force           Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
  --job-id TEXT     OCID of the Transfer Job [required]
  --from-json TEXT  Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file
                    using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                    
                    The --generate-full-
                    command-json-input option can be used to generate a sample
                    json file to be used with this command option. The key names
                    are pre-populated and match the command option names
                    (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                    compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be
                    populated by the user before using the sample file as an
                    input to this command. For any command option that accepts
                    multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                    Options can still be provided on the command line. If an
                    option exists in both the JSON document and the command line
                    then the command line specified value will be used.

Usage: oci dts job verify-upload-user-credentials [OPTIONS]

  Verifies the transfer disk or appliance upload user credentials.

Options:
  --bucket TEXT     Upload bucket name [required]

                    multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
