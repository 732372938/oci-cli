                          format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while

                          command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                          values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                          Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                          an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                          command line then the command line specified value
                          will be used.

$ oci dts job create --help
Usage: oci dts job create [OPTIONS]

  Creates a new transfer disk or appliance job.

Options:
  --wait-for-state [INITIATED|PREPARING|ACTIVE|DELETED|CLOSED]
                                  This operation creates, modifies or deletes a
                                  resource that has a defined lifecycle state.
                                  Specify this option to perform the action and
                                  then wait until the resource reaches a given
                                  lifecycle state. Multiple states can be
                                  specified, returning on the first state. For
                                  example, --wait-for-state SUCCEEDED --wait-
                                  for-state FAILED would return on whichever
                                  lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout
                                  is reached, a return code of 2 is returned.
                                  For any other error, a return code of 1 is
                                  returned.
  --max-wait-seconds INTEGER      The maximum time to wait for the resource to
                                  reach the lifecycle state defined by --wait-
                                  for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
  --wait-interval-seconds INTEGER
                                  Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see
                                  whether the resource to see if it has reached
                                  the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-
                                  state. Defaults to 30 seconds.

  --freeform-tags COMPLEX TYPE    Simple key-value pair that is applied without

                                  cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-

                                  This is a complex type whose
                                  value must be valid JSON. The value can be
                                  provided as a string on the command line or
                                  passed in as a file using

                                  param-json-input option can be used to
                                  generate an example of the JSON which must be
                                  provided. We recommend storing this example
                                  in
                                  a file, modifying it as needed and then
                                  passing it back in via the file:// syntax.
  --defined-tags COMPLEX TYPE     Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined
                                  keys are scoped to namespaces. Example:
                                  `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "foo-value"}}`
                                  This is a complex type whose value must be

                                  string on the command line or passed in as a
                                  file using
                                  the file://path/to/file syntax.
                                  The --generate-param-json-input option can be
                                  used to generate an example of the JSON which
                                  must be provided. We recommend storing this
                                  example
                                  in a file, modifying it as needed and
                                  then passing it back in via the file://
                                  syntax.
  --from-json TEXT                Provide input to this command as a JSON
                                  document from a file using the file://path-
                                  to/file syntax.
                                  
                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->

                                  the sample file as an input to this command.
                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
