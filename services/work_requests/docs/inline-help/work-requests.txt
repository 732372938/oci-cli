WARNING: Python 2 support is ending on December 31, 2019. Future versions of OCI CLI after January 2020, will not be compatible with Python 2. To avoid interruption at that time, please install OCI CLI in a compatible Python 3 environment.
Usage: oci work-requests [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Many of the CLI operations that you use to create and configure Compute
  resources do not take effect immediately. In these cases, the operation
  spawns an asynchronous workflow to fulfill the request. Work requests
  provide visibility into the status of these in-progress, long-running
  workflows.

  For more information about work requests and the operations that spawn work
  requests, see [Viewing the State of a Compute Work Request].

Usage: oci work-requests work-request get [OPTIONS]

  Gets the details of a work request.

Options:
  --work-request-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the work request. [required]
  --from-json TEXT        Provide input to this command as a JSON document from
                          a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                          
                          The
                          --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used
                          to generate a sample json file to be used with this
                          command option. The key names are pre-populated and
                          match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                          format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                          the values of the keys need to be populated by the
                          user before using the sample file as an input to this
                          command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                          values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                          Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                          an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                          command line then the command line specified value
                          will be used.

Usage: oci work-requests work-request list [OPTIONS]

  Lists the work requests in a compartment or for a specified resource.

Options:
  -c, --compartment-id TEXT  The [OCID] of the compartment. [required]
  --resource-id TEXT         The [OCID] of the resource.
  --limit INTEGER            For list pagination. The maximum number of results
                             per page, or items to return in a paginated "List"
                             call. For important details about how pagination
                             works, see [List Pagination].
  --page TEXT                For list pagination. The value of the `opc-next-
                             page` response header from the previous "List"
                             call. For important details about how pagination
                             works, see [List Pagination].
  --all                      Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this
                             option, then you cannot provide the --limit option.
  --page-size INTEGER        When fetching results, the number of results to
                             fetch per call. Only valid when used with --all or
                             --limit, and ignored otherwise.
  --from-json TEXT           Provide input to this command as a JSON document
                             from a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                             The --generate-full-command-json-input option can
                             be used to generate a sample json file to be used
                             with this command option. The key names are pre-
                             populated and match the command option names
                             (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id
                             --> compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                             need to be populated by the user before using the
                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.
                             
                             Options can
                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.
