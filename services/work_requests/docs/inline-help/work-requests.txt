Usage: oci work-requests work-request get [OPTIONS]

  Return the given work request.

Options:
  --work-request-id TEXT  The OCID of the work request. [required]
  --from-json TEXT        Provide input to this command as a JSON document from
                          a file using the file://path-to/file syntax.
                          
                          The
                          --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used
                          to generate a sample json file to be used with this
                          command option. The key names are pre-populated and
                          match the command option names (converted to camelCase
                          format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while
                          the values of the keys need to be populated by the
                          user before using the sample file as an input to this
                          command. For any command option that accepts multiple
                          values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
                          Options can still be provided on the command line. If
                          an option exists in both the JSON document and the
                          command line then the command line specified value
                          will be used.

                             sample file as an input to this command. For any
                             command option that accepts multiple values, the
                             value of the key can be a JSON array.

                             still be provided on the command line. If an option
                             exists in both the JSON document and the command
                             line then the command line specified value will be
                             used.
