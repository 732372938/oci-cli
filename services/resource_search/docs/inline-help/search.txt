Usage: oci search resource free-text-search [OPTIONS]

  Queries any and all compartments in the tenancy to find resources that match
  the specified criteria. Results include resources that you have permission
  to view and can span different resource types. You can also sort results
  based on a specified resource attribute.

Options:
  --text TEXT                     The text to search for. [required]
  --matching-context-type [NONE|HIGHLIGHTS]
                                  The type of matching context returned in the
                                  response. If you specify `HIGHLIGHTS`, then
                                  the service will highlight fragments in its
                                  response. (See ResourceSummary.searchContext
                                  and SearchContext for more information.) The
                                  default setting is `NONE`.
  --limit INTEGER                 The maximum number of items to return. The
                                  value must be between 1 and 1000.
  --page TEXT                     The page at which to start retrieving results.

                                  The --generate-full-command-
                                  json-input option can be used to generate a
                                  sample json file to be used with this command
                                  option. The key names are pre-populated and
                                  match the command option names (converted to
                                  camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
                                  compartmentId), while the values of the keys
                                  need to be populated by the user before using

                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
                                  
                                  Options can still be provided on the
                                  command line. If an option exists in both the
                                  JSON document and the command line then the
                                  command line specified value will be used.

                                  For any command option that accepts multiple
                                  values, the value of the key can be a JSON
                                  array.
